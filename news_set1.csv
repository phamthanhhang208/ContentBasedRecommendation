"Singapore: Buoyant oil prices sustained a rally in Asia Wednesday driven by hopes the crude supply glut would ease and expectations the US central bank would hold off from raising interest rates.A softening of the US currency also helped bolster prices as the dollar-priced commodity becomes cheaper for holders of weaker units, spurring demand, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for November delivery rose 55 cents to $49.08 and Brent crude for November advanced 40 cents to $52.32 a barrel in late-morning trade.Prices fell to six-year lows in August on strong production from the United States and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, but have since crept higher.The recent rally began last week after data showed a drop in US drilling activity, raising hopes this would help ease the oversupply.The US Department of Energy has forecast production to decline to an average of 8.9 million barrels per day next year from 9.2 million in 2015.Expectations that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, would not raise interest rates this year because of the weak global economy also boosted oil prices, analysts said.""We no longer look for lift-off until the first quarter of 2016. It may not come then either,"" DBS Bank said.Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, said an interest rate hike seemed less likely after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday downgraded its growth forecasts for the world economy.The global economy will expand just 3.1 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year, the IMF predicted, revising downward its previous forecasts by 0.2 percentage points in both cases.""It is no secret that the IMF wants the Fed to delay its planned rate hike until next year, and the economic undercurrents increasingly lean towards that direction,"" Aw said.""Furthermore, the IMF sees risks for emerging economies.""A rate increase will typically boost the dollar, making oil more expensive, hurting demand and prices.

"WASHINGTON: An International Monetary Fund (IMF) report on Tuesday said that the government of Pakistan has given a timetable for privatisation to IMF according to which privatisation for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) will be completed by December this year, while for Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) by March 2016.Meanwhile, speaking on conference call to journalists in Pakistan, IMF Mission Chief Pakistan, Harald Finger, said that the privatization of public entities in Pakistan is slow, however, the delay process exists in most countries. He added that the restructuring of railways is highly recommended.He went on to say that distributing companies in the power sector need to be privatised, while the collection of bills needs to increase, theft should be controlled and reduction in line losses should be maintained.Harald Finger further said that circular debt stands at 2 percent of the GDP and over three years it needs to come further down.

"ISLAMABAD: Erratic monsoon rains have made it increasingly hard for rice farmer Sardar Muhammad to bring in a good harvest. But learning how to plant seed directly in his fields – rather than transplanting seedlings, as farmers have for centuries in parched Punjab province – is helping him manage scarce water better and get a decent crop. Growing rice this way ""requires less labour, less irrigation"", he said. The rice seed is sown straight into moist soil and does not require continuous submergence.So far 30 farmers have applied the improved, water-saving rice cultivation technique on a total of 48 hectares (118.6 acres) in Punjab province. With the traditional method, in contrast, rice seedlings are first cultivated in nurseries for several weeks before being transferred to flooded fields. About a third more water is required through the growing cycle, and the crop takes 15 to 20 days longer to mature. On average in Pakistan, some 3,000 litres of water are used to produce 1 kilogramme of rice, which is the main staple food.But as the country's already scarce water resources dwindle, there is increasing pressure to find more water-efficient growing methods. A recent report from the Planning Commission of Pakistan shows that, in 1951, per-capita water availability was 5,650 cubic metres. By 2010, that figure had plunged to 1,000 cubic metres and is projected to fall to 800 cubic metres by 2025, when the population is expected to hit 221 million.Finding ways to grow more food with less water will be crucial in Pakistan as climate change alters weather patterns, affects monsoon rainfall and reduces groundwater, experts say.Planting rice directly in fields may be one way to keep up food production and help reduce the migration already happening as hard-hit, small-scale farmers give up on their fields and trek to towns and cities in search of other work.INNOVATION BENEFITSMuhammad, who grows rice on his family's 15 hectares (37 acres) in Sheikhupura district, said switching to the new planting method had cut the amount of irrigation needed in his rice fields by around 40 percent, a crucial change as groundwater levels drop.""This is really no small benefit,"" he said, smiling. ""This is helping us adapt to water shortages.""Muhammad learned the new technique under a four-year agricultural innovation programme, launched in 2013 by partners including the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the International Rice Research Institute.The $30 million project aims to help Pakistan's farmers boost their profits while coping with climate change risks to the sustainability of water and agriculture, said John Groarke, head of USAID in Pakistan.Besides its work on rice, the programme has introduced heat-tolerant maize and higher-yielding wheat varieties, he added.Muhammad Ibrahim Mughal, chairman of Agri Forum Pakistan, a farmers' rights organisation, said traditional rice cultivation was time-consuming and laborious, as farmers spend long hours bent over in fields.It has also become less viable as river flows decrease and groundwater declines, he added.As a result, farmers are now increasingly willing to experiment with the new growing technique, said Sardar Karim, another farmer from Punjab province.Direct sowing is producing a 25 percent boost in harvests under ideal conditions on the test plots, said Iftikhar Ahmed, chairman of the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council.

"Singapore: Oil fell in Asia Monday after official data showed China´s economy posted its slowest growth for more than six years in the third quarter, reinforcing worries about demand from the world´s top energy guzzler.The government said gross domestic product (GDP) for the world´s second-biggest economy rose 6.9 percent in the three months to September, beating market forecasts but still the worst since 2009.Growth in China´s industrial production, which measures output at factories, workshops and mines, also dropped sharply to 5.7 percent year-on-year in September, the government said.""Although China´s retail sales turned out strong, industrial related data remained weak. This would likely be weighing down on commodity usage in China,"" Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said in a market commentary.""With weak Chinese industrial production, we may see Chinese manufacturing PMI worsen, thus, leading to weaker oil prices,"" he said, referring to the forward-looking Purchasing Managers´ Index to be released later this week.The market will also be on the lookout for economic data from the United States and the eurozone expected to be released this week.""Considering the expectations for both China and eurozone, we could see US being the tie breaker between oil bulls and bears. US data has not been exceptionally strong, and thus, could mean that oil prices could be facing some headwinds towards the end of the week,"" Ang said.In Asian trade, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery was down 10 cents to $47.16 and Brent crude for December fell 12 cents to $50.34 a barrel at around 0300 GMT.Both contracts fell for four straight trading days last week before advancing Friday on the back of data showing a fresh decline in US oil exploration, which suggested lower output that could help ease the global oversupply.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY, said the market will also be seeking clues from a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC technical experts in Vienna on Wednesday.Oil-producer Russia said last week it was prepared to discuss output cuts during the meeting.

"Singapore: Oil prices edged up in Asia Thursday, lifted by bargain-hunting following a sharp decline the day before, although analysts said the market remains hobbled by an oversupply of the commodity.A report released Wednesday showing a bigger-than-expected increase in US crude stockpiles has stoked fresh worries about a global glut that has depressed oil prices for more than a year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December rose 25 cents to $45.45 and Brent crude for December climbed 21 cents to $48.06 a barrel at around 0300 GMT.The rebound followed Wednesday´s steep fall after the US Energy Information Administration said the country´s commercial crude-oil inventories jumped by eight million barrels to 476.6 million in the week ending October 16.The increase, which typically indicates weaker demand in the world´s number one economy, was more than double market expectations.Oil prices took a hit at the start of the week when China said gross domestic product grew in the third quarter at its slowest pace in more than six years.""Worries about the health of the Chinese economy continue to batter commodities prices.

"TOKYO: Asian stocks on Monday were close to wiping out all their losses since China´s shock currency devaluation in August, as global equities rallied after the Chinese central bank cut rates and US tech giants provided upbeat earnings guidance.MSCI´s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent to hit its highest since Aug. 12, led by 1.2 percent gains in Honk Kong. Japan´s Nikkei rose 1.1 percent to a two-month high.The surprise move by China lifted risk assets that had been already boosted by Thursday´s message from the European Central Bank that it stood ready to enhance quantitative easing and cut interest rates to even deeper negative levels.""These moves by the ECB and China are raising speculation that the Bank of Japan will act later on this week as well,"" Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. The BOJ will hold its next policy review on Friday.The US Federal Reserve is also widely expected to refrain from raising rates at its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.Against these backdrop, the MSCI's index of the world's share markets shot up to its highest level since Aug. 20, having risen more than 10 percent from its two-year low hit less than a month ago.It has recovered most of the losses since Aug. 11, when China's sudden devaluation of the yuan sparked worries its economy may be in deeper trouble than many had thought.On Wall Street, S&P 500 Index rose 1.1 percent to turn positive on the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent.Technology shares led the way, thanks to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, after the three companies reported earnings results. The former two hit record highs, while Microsoft rose to a 15-year high.Mainland Chinese shares rose on Monday after China cut the benchmark one-year lending rate - for the sixth time in less than a year - by 25 basis points to 4.35 percent, and lowered big banks' reserve requirement ratio late.Gains were fairly limited, however, with Shanghai composite index up just 0.5 percent.Naoki Tashiro, the president of TS China Research, noted that in the week following each of the past year's five rate mainland shares rose three times but fell twice.""Mainland investors are cautious. The market has been rallying so far this month, so some investors could may well take profits into rally,"" he said.One big focus is Chinese Communist party's central committee meeting from Monday to Thursday to set out a new five-year plan, while investors attempt to gauge how much China's growth is likely to slow in coming years.Ahead of the central committee meeting, Premier Li Keqiang said that China has never stated the economy must grow seven percent this year, coinciding with remarks by a top central bank official on Saturday that China would be able to keep annual economic growth at around 6-7 percent over that period.Risk sentiment supported by Thursday's message from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that the bank stood ready to enhance quantitative easing.That saw the Italian and Spanish two-year government bond yields both turn negative for the first time, meaning investors effectively pay to hold them.The benchmark German two-year yield fell further to minus 0.345 percent.As negative yields undermine the attraction of holding the euro, traders pushed it to a 2 1/2-month low of $1.0989 in early Asian trade. It last stood at $1.1031, bouncing back on profit-taking.The yen dipped to 121.60 to the dollar, its lowest since late August as traders speculated the Bank of Japan might unleash additional easing on Friday, before bouncing back to 121.16 on profit-taking.""The Japanese economy is weaker than in August and there's no sign of a rebound. Markets are now expecting easing from the BOJ,"" said Takeru Ogihara, chief strategist at Mizuho Trust Bank.Despite a recovery in global equity prices, oil prices were softer, pressured by ongoing oversupply worries.Brent futures stood at $44.68, hardly recovering after a fall of 5.6 percent last week, not far from three-week low of $44.20 touched on Friday.

""Thanks to this agreement, Europe will also become the only region in the world which legally guarantees open internet and net neutrality,"" del Castillo told parliament in the eastern French city of Strasbourg.""The principle of net neutrality will be applied directly in the 28 member states.

"KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee on Wednesday slipped to a fresh two-year low of 105.80 against the US dollar in the interbank market, falling 56 paisa from its previous closing. In the open market, the rupee was down 30 paisa from Tuesday's closing, trading at 105.60 against the USD. Due to the rise in the value of the dollar by Rs 1.40 in the last two days, Pakistan's external debt is likely to see an increase of Rs 84 billion, analysts said. The recent climb of the dollar against the rupee has been attributed to a strong demand of the greenback from importers and its outflows from the country. Currency dealers say the growing demand is due to oil-related payments.""There were a few import payments in the market and banks were already short of them, and as the rupee crossed the 104.50 level it triggered 'stop', surging the rupee past the 105 figure,"" Eman Khan from Tresmark, an application that tracks financial markets, told The News on Tuesday.

"Singapore: Oil prices tumbled in Asia Thursday, cutting short a rally the day before after hints of an interest rate hike in December by the US Federal Reserve boosted the dollar.Prices rose Wednesday after the US Department of Energy said the country´s commercial crude stockpiles had increased less than expected, suggesting stronger demand in the world´s top oil consuming nation.But the rebound was punctured after the Fed on Wednesday signalled it could raise rates before the end of the year, expressing optimism for the world´s top economy after ""solid"" consumer spending and business investment.""With the Federal Reserve holding off on interest rates hikes on Wednesday, the market will keep watch on the December meeting where a rate hike is likely in play,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.At around 0330 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was trading 16 cents lower at $45.78 and Brent crude for December was down 21 cents at $48.84.US oil prices jumped more than six percent in Wednesday´s session after news domestic crude supplies rose less than expected in the week ending October 23.The news helped ease some fears over a glut of world supplies that experts warn could last well into next year, which has seen oil prices more than halve from last year´s highs.But the rally was cut short when the US central bank explicitly pointed to the possibility of a rate hike in its next meeting in December, dampening market predictions it could be held off until March.The news pushed the dollar higher -- an interest rate hike is bullish for the dollar as it attracts investors to the currency in the quest for higher returns.But because oil is traded in dollars, a strong US currency will make the commodity more expensive for holders of weaker units, hurting demand and prices.""We are still expecting the Fed rate normalisation to be an eventuality and the latest Federal Open Market Committee decision further reaffirms our expectation for the first hike (since 2006) to take place in the 15-16 December 2015 FOMC (meeting),"" United Overseas Bank said.

"Tokyo: Asian stocks dipped in early trade Monday, while the dollar retreated against most regional currencies as a weak reading in a Chinese manufacturing index stirred worries about the world´s number two economy.On equity markets, there were losses across the board as Sunday data showed activity in China´s vast manufacturing sector declined in October for the third straight month, triggering worries about the Chinese economy, a crucial driver of global growth.Investors also turned to profit taking after equity markets surged last month, recovering from their worst quarter in four years during July-September, as analysts said fresh cues were needed for markets to rally further.China´s Purchasing Managers´ Index (PMI), tracking activity in the factory and workshop sector, was unchanged from the previous month at 49.8, the state statistics office said Sunday.A PMI figure above 50 signals expanding activity while anything below indicates shrinkage.""I´m struggling to see catalysts to encourage the market to take this rally to the next level,"" said Tony Farnham, a strategist at Patersons Securities Ltd.""China´s PMI numbers were underwhelming. Manufacturing will probably remain weak as China tries to rebalance its economy away from manufacturing and into services.""Tokyo was down 1.87 percent by the lunch break on the weak figures, Hong Kong fell 0.60 percent in early trade and Shanghai dropped 0.38 percent. Sydney lost 1.26 percent as oil halted a three-day climb, while Seoul edged up 0.17 percent after a drop in South Korean exports.On Wall Street Friday, the Dow fell 0.52 percent, the S&P 500 lost 0.48 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 0.40 percent.- Dollar retreats -The dollar remained under selling pressure against emerging currencies and the yen early Monday, after stagnant US economic indicators bolstered the argument against a December rate hike.The US government said Friday its consumer spending rose only by 0.1 percent in the United States in September, less than expected and the slowest rate since January.While the US Federal Reserve said earlier this year it expected to tighten monetary policy before 2016, the summer´s turmoil on global markets and a slowdown in the world economy have forced policymakers to stay their hand.""Tokyo has taken over the dollar-selling sentiment from New York,"" Minori Uchida, head of Tokyo global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, told AFP.""It is difficult to buy the dollar now as the recent economic figures are not strong enough to justify a rate hike,"" Uchida said.Many economists now are tipping a lift-off early in the new year, bolstering emerging market currencies, which had been hammered this year on talk of a 2015 move as investors remove their cash to the United States in search of better, safer returns.In early trade on Monday, the Malaysian ringgit added 0.21 percent against the dollar, while the Indonesian rupiah advanced 0.20 percent, the Singapore dollar rose 0.07 percent, Taiwan´s dollar gained 0.35 percent and the Thai baht was 0.14 percent higher.The greenback bought 120.40 yen from 120.67 yen Friday in New York.

"Singapore: Oil prices rebounded in Asia Tuesday, buoyed by bargain hunting ahead of the release of US government data that will gauge crude demand in the world´s biggest economy.Analysts expect the data to be released Wednesday by the US Energy Department to show that commercial crude stockpiles rose in the week to October 30 which typically means weaker demand in the world´s top oil consuming nation.Despite occasional rallies, oil remains generally bogged down by a global crude supply glut that has outpaced demand and depressed prices for more than a year.""Expectations of more US stockpiles restrained oil bulls,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.A global economic slowdown led by China has hammered demand for the commodity and highlighted worries that there may not be enough economic activity to soak up excess supplies as output levels from oil producing nations remain high.China´s official purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector showed activity shrank in October for the third straight month.Russian oil production broke a post-Soviet record in October, climbing to 10.78 million barrels per day, according to Bloomberg News.At around 0310 GMT Tuesday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was up 16 cents at $46.30 and Brent crude for December was trading 11 cents higher at $48.90 a barrel.Prices dipped on Monday after data showed China´s manufacturing output continued to contract and Russian oil production hit a new record high.Current price levels are more than 50 percent lower from their peaks in June 2014 when a barrel of oil was selling at over $100.

"London: The oil market rose on Friday but gains were limited by the global supply glut and after the US Federal Reserve hinted at a December interest rate hike.In midday deals in London, Brent North Sea crude for December won 44 cents to stand at $48.42 per barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December rose 26 cents to $45.46 per barrel compared with Thursday´s close. Despite the slender gains, prices are lower compared with the previous week as the market struggles with a crude oversupply and weak demand owing to sluggish global growth led by top energy guzzler China.Increasing talk of an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve has also bolstered the dollar, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for weaker currencies, hurting demand and prices.A meeting last month of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) hinted that a decision to implement the first rate hike since 2006 could be made during a December meeting.Comments this week by Fed chair Janet Yellen and New York Fed president Bill Dudley considered as ""hawkish"" by the market have firmed up expectations for the December FOMC meeting ""as a live possibility for the first Fed rate hike in nearly a decade,"" Singapore´s United Overseas Bank said.Markets are watching the US non-farm payrolls data to be released later Friday for further signs about the health of the US economy which could help swing any decision on interest rates, it said.The data is a closely watched gauge of the unemployment situation in the world´s biggest economy and top oil consuming nation.Oil prices have plunged by more than half from peaks of over $100 a barrel in June last year.The International Monetary Fund has projected slower growth for the world economy this year and next.

"LIMASSOL: Moody’s Investors Service on Wednesday changed the outlook for the Pakistan banking system to stable from negative, reflecting the improvement in the country’s economic growth prospects, driven in turn by the government’s commitment to economic reforms under its IMF program.“We expect the strengthening economy, together with the central bank’s accommodative monetary policy, to stimulate lending growth and support the banking sector’s loan performance over the next 12-18 months,"" said Elena Panayiotou, a Moody’s Assistant Vice President and lead analyst for Pakistani banks.Moody’s forecasts Pakistan’s real GDP will expand by 4.0 per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2016 (compared to a sluggish 2.8pc during 2008-13), mainly driven by higher spending on infrastructure projects as the government aims to ease energy shortages and execute projects associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The rating agency noted that the strengthening of the domestic economy will contribute to the improvement in Pakistani banks’ asset quality. The level of credit risk, however, will remain high as banks are heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign (B3, stable) through holdings of securities and government-related loans, which were equivalent in size to 7.3x Tier 1 capital, exposing banks to event risk.""We expect problem loans will decline to around 12 per cent of total loans by the end of 2016 compared with 12.4pc for the end of June 2015. Banks, however, will remain heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign, linking the banks’ creditworthiness to that of the sovereign"" Panayiotou said.In the area of capital, the rating agency expected that buffers will come under pressure due to moderate asset growth and lower internal capital generation – a result of weaker profitability.Moody’s expected earnings to ease slightly over the outlook period, mainly because of the lower coupon on government securities in a declining interest rate environment and as the market’s perception of Pakistan’s risk profile eases (upgraded to B3 from Caa1 on June 11, 2015). Higher loan volumes and capital gains booked through the sale of government securities will only partially offset the pressure on profitability.In addition, the rating agency expected that Pakistani banks will maintain ample liquidity and continue to benefit from large volumes of low-cost and stable customer deposits.""The Pakistani banks’ deposit-based funding structure remains a credit strength. We expect inflows of remittances from migrant workers will continue to drive the growth in bank deposits and support banks’ funding bases,"" said the asst vice-president of Moody's.While banks will use part of their liquid asset to fund lending, Moody’s expected the sector to maintain strong liquidity buffers, with core liquid assets – defined as cash and bank placements – at 12 per cent of total assets and liquid securities, more broadly defined, at 41pc of total assets as of June 2015.

""One of the main reasons is that we will launch our own national missile project,"" added the official.The news came as Turkey hosted key Western allies including US President Barack Obama but also Chinese leader Xi Jinping for the summit of G20 top economies in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya.Turkey entered negotiations in 2013 with the China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation (CPMIEC) to finalise a contract worth $3.4 billion (3 billion euros).French-Italian consortium Eurosam and US-listed Raytheon Co had also submitted offers but the government had prioritised talks with the Chinese company, which raised serious concerns over the compatibility of CPMIEC´s systems with NATO missile defences.NATO has said missile systems within the alliance must be compatible with each other while calling on Turkey to take this factor into account.Turkish government sources said an official announcement was expected next week. A second Turkish official said the issue of technology transfer was one of the major stumbling blocks in negotiations with the Chinese company.""They refused to give what we demanded,"" the official told AFP, without elaborating. ""The talks were blocked at some point.""Although the government´s current plans to build Turkish-made missile defence system, it was not immediately clear if Ankara would launch talks with the European and American contenders.Washington was particularly irked by Turkish decision to negotiate with the Chinese company, which has been hit by a series of US sanctions for selling arms and missile technology to Iran and Pakistan.Turkey in the past made confusing comments over its lucrative tender, with a government minister saying the Chinese company was the winner and that its system could be used without integrating with NATO systems.But a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had insisted that the missile system would be harmonious and integrated with NATO defence architecture.

"Hong Kong: Asian stock markets tumbled and the euro lost ground early Monday in the first trades after the deadly weekend terror attacks in Paris.The late-night assault on Friday in French capital, which killed 129 people, sparked concerns about security in Europe and its impact on the already struggling eurozone economy.It also sowed fresh uncertainty in already nervous markets, which ended last week on a low owing to increasing worries about the state of the global economy.Losses across Asian stock markets were joined by a fall in the euro, which is already under pressure from expectations the European Central Bank will loosen monetary policy to shore up the eurozone.""There is no doubt that the attacks in Paris will contribute to short-term investor nervousness,"" Shane Oliver, Sydney-based strategist at AMP Capital Investors, said.However, he added that he expected the Paris-linked losses to be brief and pointed out that markets had bounced back from initial selling following past terror attacks.""I think history will repeat itself. It will just be a short selloff in response to the Paris attacks,"" he told Bloomberg News.In early trade Hong Kong was 1.2 percent off, Tokyo fell one percent and Sydney gave up 0.9 percent.Adding to selling pressure in Tokyo Monday was data showing the Japanese economy had slipped into recession for the second time in three years, throwing into question the government´s much-vaunted drive to kickstart growth and inflation.- Shanghai retreats -The Cabinet Office said gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.2 percent in July-September, or 0.8 percent on an annualised basis, marking the second straight quarterly decline -- a technical recession.The preliminary figure was worse than the 0.1 percent decline forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and will put pressure on the Bank of Japan to ramp up its bond-buying scheme of monetary easing. The central bank is scheduled to hold a policy meeting this week.The soft results continue to flow despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe´s big-spending three-year plan -- dubbed ""Abenomics"" -- to revitalise the torpid economy and end years of debilitating deflation.Taro Saito, director of economic research at NLI Research Institute, told AFP: ""Companies are reluctant to invest despite their sound profits."" He added that while consumer spending improved ""its overall trend still remains weak"".In China, authorities doubled the deposit required for investors to borrow funds to trade stocks -- known as margin trading -- as they try to limit a practice that led a massive market bubble and summer rout.The minimum requirement for margin trading was hiked to 100 percent from 50 percent, meaning traders must have the same level of funds in their accounts as the amount they want to borrow.Margin trading was behind a stock market rally that sent the Shanghai index up 150 percent in a year, before it crashed in June.The move comes as Shanghai rebounds from the summer volatility, with the benchmark index now up 22 percent from its August low.

"KARACHI:  State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Saturday announced its monetary policy and decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.A statement issued here said that the average Jul-Oct FY16 inflation was at 1.7 percent is lower than the 7.1 percent average inflation in the corresponding period of last year.It said that the decline is broad based as both food and non-food and core inflation measures came down in this period.Going forward with subdued outlook of international oil price and other major commodity prices and in the absence of any shock to supplies of food items even though the average inflation would remain below the FY16 annual target of 6 percent the headline inflation is expected to reverse its declining momentum.Moreover market surveys indicate a marginal increase in inflation expectations for the coming months.The SBP statement further pointed out that the current account deficit despite a year on year 10.6 percent contraction in exports has narrowed down to $ 532 million in Jul-Oct FY16 from $ 1.9billion in Jul-Oct FY15. The improvement largely owes to declining oil price that has substantially reduced the oil import payments healthy workers remittances and the realization of Coalition Support Fund.At the back of official disbursements and Eurobond inflows surplus in capital and financial account has supported the overall balance of payments position thus ensuring an upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves in Jul Oct FY16. Going forward continued flow of external resources would be required to maintain the stable balance of payments position.Furthermore, realization of investment inflows stemming from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor would indeed strengthen the external sector outlook over the medium to long term.Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) mainly supported by food and beverages, automobiles, fertilizers and cement production increased to 3.9 percent in Jul Sep 2015 compared to 2.6 percent in the same period of last year.Further boost to this growth is expected from expansion in cotton yarn manufacturing strong construction activities as per planned development spending increased automobile production encouraged by government schemes and improving energy supply at the back of recent LNG imports.Credit to private sector witnessed a nominal increase in July-October 2015 wherein fixed investments continued to expand for the fourth consecutive quarter from Q2 FY15 to Q1 FY16. As a result of easy monetary policy, the weighted average lending rates on fresh and outstanding loans at 7.8 percent and 9.2 percent in September2015 are the lowest in 10 years.Thus, with current credit cycle now entering in uptake phase and with improving LSM growth borrowing on account of both the working capital and fixed investment is likely to increase.This outlook would reflect in broad money (M2) growth going forward which during July 01-November 06, 2015 M2 has expanded by 0.2percent against 0.7 percent during the same period last year.While the Net Domestic Assets declined by Rs 78 billion Net Foreign Assets contribution in M2 growth remained substantial as it increased by Rs106 billion.In view of the foregoing the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.

""Crude oil appears to find some bottom at current levels, although it will find it difficult to break higher as bears are clearly waiting in the folds to knock it lower each time there is a rally,"" he said.

Konta will meet the Russian No21 seed, Ekaterina Makarova, after she eliminated No9 seed Karolina Pliskova.On this showing and her earlier efforts, Konta is now a serious danger to the higher seeds in her first Australian Open.

"SYDNEY: Manish Pandey struck his maiden one-day century in a high-scoring thriller to secure India a pride-salvaging six-wicket victory against Australia in the fifth and final ODI in Sydney on Saturday.Staring at a series whitewash after four defeats, India rode Pandey´s scintillating 104 off 81 balls to chase down a 331-run victory target with two balls to spare.Centuries from David Warner (122) and Mitchell Marsh (102) helped Australia post 330-7 but Pandey´s knock in his only fourth one-dayer clinched the contest for India.India needed a strong start from their openers to stay on course to chase down such a big total and the visitors got just that from Shikhar Dhawan (78) and Rohit Sharma (99).Dhawan posted his third successive 50-plus score and Rohit fell agonisingly short of his third century in the series as they raised 123 runs in 18.2 overs.John Hastings dismissed Dhawan and Virat Kohli (eight) in quick successions to halt India´s progress and Rohit left leaving India needing exactly 100 runs from 91 balls to win the contest.With the required run-rate skyrocketing and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (34) struggling to time the ball at the other end, Pandey´s crisp hitting left India needing 13 runs off the last over from Marsh.Marsh began with a wide and had his next hit out of the ground by Dhoni but the Indian captain fell immediately to inject fresh drama in the contest.Pandey, however, was unfazed and he hit the next ball for a boundary to first complete his century and then scurried for two for the winning run.Earlier, Warner struck his fifth ODI century and Mitchell Marsh notched up his first to set up yet another runfest in a series that has provided 3,159 runs.India´s much-maligned bowlers did well to reduce Australia to 117-4 in the 22nd over before Warner and Marsh combined to add 118 runs in 17.3 overs.Warner had fallen seven runs short of a century in Wednesday´s fourth ODI at Canberra but there was no such heartbreak this time as the southpaw brought up his run-a-ball century.The 27-year-old opener was eventually dismissed for 122, that included thee sixes and nine boundaries, but Marsh carried on to remain not out on 102 off 84 balls.For India, Jasprit Bumrah made an impressive debut, the right-arm paceman with an unorthodox bowling action sending down 10 tidy overs to claim 2-40 with some tight death bowling.Pandey was adjudged man-of-the-match, while team mate Rohit won the man-of-the-series award for the 441 runs he amassed in five matches.

There was no questioning the commitment of Raonic and Wawrinka as the pair slugged out a three-hour 44-minute thriller in the day session on Rod Laver Arena.Long seen as a threat to the Novak Djokovic-led establishment, 25-year-old Raonic showed ice in his veins to fend off the 2014 champion 6-4 6-3 5-7 4-6 6-3 after the 30-year-old Swiss roared back from two sets down.Unveiling an aggressive serve-volley game, Raonic fired 82 winners past the fourth seed to set up a second successive quarter-final at Melbourne Park.Having lost to Djokovic a year ago, he will be favourite against French showman Gael Monfils who delighted fans with some spectacular dives as he beat Russian Andrey Kuznetsov 7-5 3-6 6-3 7-6(4) to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.Raonic is on an eight-match winning streak since the start of the year, a run which included upsetting Roger Federer to win the Brisbane International, and he credits new coach Carlos Moya for giving him confidence to stray from the baseline.""He´s sort of organising my strengths, my weapons and how to use them better,"" the 13th seed told reporters.

"MELBOURNE: Second seed Andy Murray had his feathers ruffled but scrapped his way into the Australian Open quarter-finals with a 6-4 6-4 7-6(4) victory over local hope Bernard Tomic on Monday.The Briton, four-times a runner-up at Melbourne Park, was close to exasperation after being broken four times by the unorthodox Australian world number 17 but dug deep when it mattered to reach the last eight for the seventh year in a row.Murray had endured a tricky couple of days since Nigel Sears, the father of his pregnant wife Kim, collapsed in the stands on Rod Laver Arena and was taken to hospital while the Scot was playing his third round tie on Margaret Court Arena.As Sears, the coach of Ana Ivanovic, has since been discharged and cleared to join his daughter in England, Murray hoped he would have a calmer preparation for his quarter-final encounter with Spanish eighth seed David Ferrer.Murray, 28, enjoyed success with the drop shot early in the match but that started to wane in a match that was always interesting if never turning into a real contest.Tomic, 23, showed flashes of the quality that has had Australia raving about his potential since his early teens but was unable to maintain the level of his performance for sufficiently long periods to cause an upset.Murray, who fired 18 aces and 43 winners, clinched a topsy turvy third set in the tiebreak when Tomic went long with a return after two and a half hours on court.""I just felt I was very uncomfortable,"" Tomic, who dropped serve three times in the first set, said.""While on paper it looked like a close match it was uncomfortable for me.<br/> I didn´t play the game the way I wanted to but he didn´t let me.""After Johanna Konta earlier earned her place in the quarter-finals, Murray´s victory means Britain will have a presence in the last eight of both draws of a grand slam for the first time since the 1977 Australian Open.Murray has his eye firmly fixed on becoming Britain´s first men´s champion in Australia since Fred Perry in 1934 but he must get past Ferrer to do it.

The hosts led by 356 runs on a pitch that has turn, movement and uneven bounce.The pair have put on 117 for the fifth wicket and kept England wicketless between lunch and tea after the touring side had made good inroads in the opening session when a fired-up James Anderson grabbed two early wickets and Ben Stokes another.South Africa, who are likely to be down to three front-line bowlers in the second innings with seamer Kyle Abbott struggling due to a hamstring problem, must decide what target they want to set England with four sessions remaining.They will be mindful of overworking their depleted attack as they chase a consolation victory in the test with England already having claimed the series.The previous highest chase successful in Test matches at Centurion Park was 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the contest and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.Anderson had earlier taken his number of test wickets to 433, one short of Indian great Kapil Dev in sixth place on the all-time list.He first induced a rash drive from opener Stephen Cook (25) that provided a catch for wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and two balls later grabbed the big scalp of home captain AB de Villiers, lbw without scoring.It was the third duck in a row for De Villiers, comfortably his worst run of form in Test cricket since he made his debut in 2004.Stokes removed JP Duminy (29) caught behind by Bairstow to leave South Africa sweating at 106 for four, before Amla and Bavuma edged the home side ahead again.
