The single currency bought $1.2061 compared to $1.2160 in pre-holiday trade.The ECB has already used several tools to push inflation in member nations back up to the 2.0 percent annual rate it regards as healthy, including asset purchases and making cheap loans available to banks.It is also examining the possibility of large-scale purchases of sovereign debt -- so-called quantitative easing (QE) -- to help jump-start the European Union´s moribund economy.Oil prices rose on Friday, with US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rising 44 cents to $54.07 and Brent crude for February gaining 18 cents to $57.51.""The gains in Asian trading are likely because of the positive US crude stockpiles data released on Wednesday,"" Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore, told AFP.US crude reserves fell by 1.8 million barrels in the week to December 26, the US Energy Information Administration said in its last petroleum report for 2014 released on Wednesday, boosting prices that lost nearly half their value in the second half of the year.There is growing speculation that the slide in global oil prices -- the biggest since the financial crisis in 2008 -- may have been excessive.""If we do see some supply-side responses, or even if they´re anticipated over the course of this first quarter of the year, we might find that oil has in fact bottomed,"" Michael McCarthy, a chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told Bloomberg.Gold was at $1,182.36 an ounce, compared with $1,199.00 in end-of-year trading on Wednesday.In other markets:-- Jakarta ended up 0.30 percent, or 15.82 points, at 5,242.77.Coal firm Indo Tambangraya Megah gained 3.41 percent to 15,900 rupiah, while miner Aneka Tambang slipped 1.88 percent to 1,045 rupiah.-- Malaysia´s main stock index shed 0.48 percent, or 8.48 points, to close at 1,752.77.Malayan Banking lost 0.55 percent to 9.12 ringgit, Public Bank slipped 0.44 percent to 18.22 while Top Globe added 1.77 percent 4.60 ringgit.-- Singapore rose 0.16 percent, or 5.44 points, to 3,370.59.Agribusiness company Wilmar International gained 0.93 percent to Sg$3.27 while real estate developer Capitaland dipped 0.30 percent to Sg$3.30.-- Mumbai gained 1.38 percent, or 380.36 points, to end at 27,887.90.Housing Development Finance Corp rose 4.30 percent to 1,171.80 rupees, while Mahindra & Mahindra fell 0.92 percent to 1,224.80 rupees.

"HONG KONG: Asian markets tumbled Tuesday following painful losses in New York and Europe while the euro sat near nine-year lows as political uncertainty in Greece fanned renewed fears it could leave the eurozone.Oil prices, which fell below the psychological $50 a barrel mark in US trade, edged up marginally but remained under pressure owing to a global supply glut, weak demand and a stronger dollar.Tokyo tumbled 2.50 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.89 percent, Sydney eased 1.67 percent, Seoul was 1.30 percent lower while Shanghai reversed earlier losses to gain 0.70 percent.The first full week of the new year got off to a traumatic start for dealers as they bet a January 25 general election in Greece will see a victory for the the left-wing Syriza party.Markets fear the party will roll back austerity measures required under the IMF-EU bailout of the country, which could in turn lead it to exit the eurozone.The year is ""barely three trading days old and already the two biggest themes that were predicted to affect the markets this year are making headlines: oversupply of commodities and the eurozone,"" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., wrote in an email to clients, according to Bloomberg News.At the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted German government sources as saying they consider Greece´s exit ""almost inevitable"" if Syriza wins the snap poll.Chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had come to consider Athens´ removal from the bloc would be ""manageable"", the magazine said.However, investors were spooked and on Monday Greek stocks sank more than 5 percent, while the Paris, Madrid and Milan exchanges fell more than 3 percent.- Oil below $50 a barrel -The Dow dived 1.86 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.83 percent and the Nasdaq lost 1.57 percent.In currency trade the euro sank to $1.1864 Monday, its lowest level since March 2006. On Tuesday morning the single currency recovered slightly buying $1.1943.The euro was meanwhile at 142.58 yen against 142.74 yen in US trade and well down from the 144.58 yen Friday.Adding to downward pressure is increased speculation that the European Central Bank will buy eurozone government bonds to counter deflation risks.The dollar was at 119.40 yen early Tuesday, compared with 119.61 in New York Monday and also well down from 120.46 yen Friday.Oil prices were marginally up Tuesday after slipping below $50 for the first time in more than five years in New York.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rose eight cents to $50.12 while Brent crude for February gained 14 cents to $53.25. WTI tapped $49.95 Monday.The cost of crude has plunged since June as supplies outstrip demand with key consumer China slowing down, the eurozone struggling and the dollar, in which it is priced, strengthening.A decision late last year by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain output despite the glut has also cut into prices.""The fundamentals of oil are unlikely to change in the first half of this year, which will see oil bedding down into its bear market for months to come,"" IG´s Lucas said.Gold was at $1,203.59.40 an ounce, compared with $1,196.40 on Monday.

"NEW YORK: US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent. The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday´s slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.""There´s serious concern the bottom´s not in yet,"" said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. ""Basically everyone who´s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.""""Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,"" said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. ""The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybody´s guess, but it appears we still have more to go.""Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq´s oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices.""I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really don´t see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter,"" Cooper said.

"SYDNEY: Australia look set to field two specialist spinners at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) for the first time in a decade when they host West Indies in a dead rubber New Year´s test starting this weekend.</strongAn inexperienced and demoralised West Indies touring party succumbed by an innings and 212 runs in Hobart and 177 runs in Melbourne to hand their hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.That position, and the likelihood of a turning wicket at the SCG, have encouraged Australia to test out the twin spin option of Nathan Lyon and Stephen O´Keefe ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka later this year.That the hosts can afford to put out an experimental side in one of the more venerable fixtures in the Australian sporting calendar is not to say there will be nothing at stake when the match gets underway on Sunday (1030 GMT).For West Indies there is pride and a chance to show more of the fighting spirit that stalled Australia´s victory match in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne last weekend.A 3-0 sweep, meanwhile, would send Australia above India to second in the test rankings and they would return to the summit if England can maintain a winning start and beat South Africa in their ongoing four-match series.Off-spinner Lyon is one of the first names on the Australian team sheet these days and he looks like being joined by left-arm finger spinner O´Keefe in the Australian line-up.That was made all the more likely when seamer Peter Siddle failed to train on Friday because of an ankle injury, leaving his place in the team in jeopardy.O´Keefe´s inclusion for his second test -- his first on home soil -- would make it the first time Australia have played twin spinners at the SCG since Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill took on South Africa at the ground in 2006.Josh Hazlewood is likely to back up for a sixth straight test alongside James Pattinson in the pace attack with all-rounder Mitchell Marsh offering support with his quickening medium pace deliveries after taking 4-61 in Melbourne.While Darren Bravo, Denesh Ramdin and skipper Jason Holder showed some resistance with the bat in Melbourne, the paucity of the West Indies bowling is starkly illustrated by the fact that they have taken just 10 wickets over the first two tests.Given how little pressure their pace attack have managed to exert on Australia so far in the series, West Indies might consider their own twin spin attack by bringing in leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo alongside left-arm orthodox Jomel Warrican.",1/1/2016,Australia set to test twin spin attack against Windi,sports
"SYDNEY: After picking up pretty much every individual honour on offer in a spectacular 2015, Australia captain Steve Smith has a more collective goal in his sights this year -- restoring his country to the top of the test rankings.</strongSmith finished his annus mirabilis as the world´s top ranked test batsman and won the ICC Cricketer and Test Cricketer of the Year awards as well as the Allan Border Medal as Australia´s best player.The 26-year-old scored a remarkable 2,369 runs across all three formats, rattling up 1,474 in tests alone at an average of 73.70 with six centuries.He was Australia´s highest run scorer as they secured a fifth 50-over World Cup triumph and he led the test side to series victories over India, New Zealand and West Indies.Even in the Ashes defeat to England, the one major blot on Australia´s copy book for the year, he scored his maiden double century to claim the Man of the Match award at Lord´s.Even before he was captain, though, Smith was always clear that team success came first.With Australia already 2-0 up in the three-match series, this week´s third test against West Indies might be a dead rubber but victory would send them above India into second place in the test rankings behind South Africa.""It´s a huge motivation, that´s what we want to be, number one in all formats and we´re working extremely hard to get there,"" Smith told reporters on the eve of the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Saturday.""It would be nice to win this week and wrap this series up 3-0. It´s been a good summer for us so far, so we´d like to finish on a high.""Defeat for South Africa in their ongoing series against England would then send Australia back to the summit but even if the English fail to build on their winning start, February´s two-test tour of New Zealand offers Smith´s side another chance.Australia beat the Black Caps 2-0 on home soil in November but the series was closer than the scoreline would suggest and Smith´s side, like many of the top test teams, have struggled to win series overseas in recent years.""Playing away from home is a challenge for all teams around the world at the moment, I think that´s one of the big things we´re going to be judged on,"" Smith added.""It´s going to be a big challenge in New Zealand, but I´m confident if we can continue playing the way we are, hopefully we can have a lot of success over there.""Smith´s own form hit a minor blip when he was dismissed for 10 in Australia´s only innings in the first test against West Indies but the runs were flowing again in Melbourne last week after knocks of 134 and 70 without being dismissed.""I felt pretty good last week, I guess it was good just to spend a little bit of time in the middle again,"" Smith said.""All of my movement and my swing and everything was back in synch.I went back and looked at some footage before the Melbourne test and felt my bat face was a little bit closed.""Last week I got my bat face back where I wanted it to be and everything felt really good, so hopefully I can score a few more this week.",1/2/2016,Australia skipper Smith plots return to test summi,sports
"WELLINGTON: New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Sunday said tainted bowler Mohammad Amir should be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to play for Pakistan in limited-overs matches in New Zealand this month.Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad which will play three Twenty20 and as many one-day games against New Zealand over the next three weeks but his participation depends on New Zealand immigration officials allowing him a visa.The fast bowler was only 18 when he handed a five-year ban from cricket in 2011 for his involvement in spot fixing.He also served three months of a six month prison term.His ban, imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career.He was a very young man at the time and he's gone through a sound rehabilitation program, McCullum said.If he gets out on the field against us, then you play against the man you're playing against, not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster, added the explosive batsman.New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir's inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation.He was a very, very young man, a boy really (when he was suspended), White said.He showed remorse at the time, admitted to it. He's gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC.I'm personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing, added White.New Zealand's immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received.A decision is likely next week.",1/3/2016,McCullum says Amir should get benefit of doub,sports

"SINGAPORE: Oil prices edged up on Wednesday in anticipation of an OPEC-led crude production cut that is planned to be finalised by the end of the month, through trading was thin ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.</strongU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were trading at $46.13 at 0128 GMT, up 10 cents from their last settlement.International Brent crude oil futures were at $49.22 a barrel, up 10 cents. Reuters commodities analyst Wang Tao said that Brent could rise to $49.85 per barrel, a level marked by several technical resistance factors.Despite Wednesday's slight increases, analysts said that the market was currently unwilling to push crude prices to $50 a barrel or higher.""The market seems unwilling to push oil towards $50 a barrel ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday tomorrow,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA brokerage in Singapore. ""Their reticence is understandable given that longs (long positions) put on above that level have not ended well in recent times.""""Tonight's (U.S.) EIA Crude Inventory numbers should provide a welcome, albeit temporary sideshow to the OPEC main event. Otherwise, we expect Asia to continue the sideways trading ranges,"" Halley said.The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due to publish official U.S. crude oil and refined product inventory data later on Wednesday.Wednesday's lethargy came after oil prices rallied earlier this week. Traders anticipated the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would successfully implement a planned, coordinated production cut - to be discussed at a Nov. 30 meeting - in order to prop up prices.However, by late Tuesday analysts had become wary of the prospects for such a deal, as it remained unclear whether major OPEC-producers Iraq and Iran were willing to participate in a meaningful way.""Cracks in the OPEC production cut agreement could see oil prices weaker in trading today,"" ANZ bank said in a note on Wednesday.""A preliminary meeting ahead of next week's OPEC gathering failed to resolve the issues around Iran and Iraq's involvement in the production cut agreement,"" it said.

"TOKYO: Pakistan LNG Ltd has received strong interest in its tender to buy as many as 240 shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from suppliers hungry to sell gas in an oversupplied market, a senior official told Reuters on Thursday.</strongThe emergence of Pakistan as a large-scale buyer is a welcome boost in the market for the supercooled gas as demand slows in traditional big buyers like Japan. Spot Asian LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen by two-thirds since the beginning of 2014 as new supplies have flooded the market.Launched earlier this month, the tender for a combination of mid- and long-term shipments ""has been extremely well received,"" said Adnan Gilani, chief operating officer of state-owned Pakistan LNG.""The response is beyond what we thought,"" the executive said, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of an LNG conference in Tokyo. Gilani didn't identify any of the bidding suppliers.The company launched its tender to purchase a combined 240 shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG),The mid-term tender covers a period of five years and calls for 60 shipments, while the long-term tender is for 15 years and 180 cargoes, according to information presented in the tender documents released on the company's website earlier this month.More than 20 global oil and gas majors and traders attended a bidders conference held by Pakistan LNG two days ago, Gilani said, adding as many as 10 more expressed interest without attending. The deadline for bidding is Dec. 20, he said.Pakistan LNG will launch a new tender for 4.5 million tonnes of LNG ""within a few months"", and six months later it will seek bids for another 4.5 million tonnes, he said.By 2019 Pakistan, which can only meet two-thirds of its gas demand, expects to be importing about 23 million tonnes of LNG a year via five terminals to fuel power stations and vehicles.""We are buying for our baseload needs,"" he said. ""Price is the main variable.""",11/24/2016,New LNG buyer Pakistan sees strong interest in giant tender,business
"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) completed the auction of all three licences for Pakistans first Direct to Home Service (DTH) after 15 hours of bidding in the wee hours of Thursday.</strongThe highest bid was raised by Mag Entertainment for Rs 4.91 billion, followed by M/s. Shahzad Sky for Rs 4.90 billion and M/s. Star time for Rs 4.89 billion respectively. A total of 11 companies  Orient Electronics Lahore, Mag Entertainment Lahore, Skyflix Islamabad, Smartimes Communications Islamabad, Sardar Builders Islamabad, Smart Sky Islamabad, Parus Media and Broadcast Islamabad, NayaTel Islamabad, Shahzad Sky, Islamabad, HB DTH Islamabad and IQ Communications Karachi  took part in the bidding process to secure the three licences.All the three licences were sold for Rs 14.69 billion, informed Chairman PEMRA Absar Alam, while speaking to the press.PEMRA Chairman congratulated the winning companies and said the initiative was going to be a game-changer for Pakistans electronic media industry.To date, this is the biggest investment in Pakistans electronic media history, he said and added as per the estimates and feasibility studies carried out by PEMRA experts, the overall investment would be $450 million ($150 million each) and could touch $750 million more in the next two years. These estimates did not include the bidding proceeds, he made it clear.The DTH service, he said, was a state-of-the art technology offering new dimensions of distribution system and a wide range of choice to consumers. The current analogue distribution system is offering a maximum of 80 channels while the DTH would increase the capacity to around 120 and each local DTH licence holder is expected to have at least 500,000 subscribers, said Absar Alam.Besides lucrative investment, the DTH regime would also make a significant contribution to job generation in the country leading to 15,000 jobs (5,000 by each company) i.e. new direct employment opportunities, he maintained.Absar Alam said the DTH service would not end the cable operators business, but would compel them to invest in technology and their distribution systems.However, the media watchdog issued non-exclusive licences for 15 years to the successful bidders after the open outcry bidding.Pakistani DTH services, once launched, will counter the sale of illegal Indian DTH services in Pakistan, which incur a heavy loss to the national exchequer because of transfer of between $200 million to $350 million to India annually on account of subscription fee. Now the legal DTH services will give consumers a choice against the current monopoly of cable operators as well.Pakistan has nearly 25 million electronic media subscribers and between three to five million consumers use Indian DTH illegally. After issuance of licences, subscribers of Indian DTH would have to shift to the local network.Similarly, foreign channels will get landing rights to come under the local regime through a regulatory process and launching of new local satellite channels will be allowed.The DTH licence holders will have to start operations within the year or risk termination of licences. The bidders are required to deposit 15 percent of the bid money at the outset of the bidding as earnest money, followed by 50 percent of the bid money upfront. The remaining amount could be paid immediately or in three yearly instalments at a mark-up rate.Each DTH licence holder is required to pay an annual fee of Rs10 million and contribute two percent of their gross revenue after the first three years of operations.Licenses to the bid winners would be awarded after clearance from the interior ministry and law enforcement agencies.",11/24/2016,Pakistans first DTH licences auctioned for Rs 1469 billi,business
"LONDON: Pakistan has secured an additional $8.5 billion of investment from Beijing as part of the countries' joint energy, transport and infrastructure plan, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Wednesday.</strongThat is on top of the $46-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, which focuses on road building and energy infrastructure to end chronic power shortages in Pakistan and to link China's landlocked north-west with the deep-water port Gwadar on the Arabian Sea.Some $4.5 billion of the additional investment will be spent on upgrading tracks and signaling on Pakistan's main railway line from Karachi to Peshawar and increase the speed on the line to 160 km per hour from the current 60-80 kph, Iqbal told Reuters in an interview.Another $4 billion will go toward an LNG terminal and transmission line, he added.""This has now all been approved, so this is an additional $8.5 billion to the $46 billion we had already, so we are now close to $55 billion,"" Iqbal said.The International Monetary Fund said in June that repayments and profit repatriation from large-scale investments such as CPEC could add to Pakistan's medium- and long-term risks, predicting that the country's gross external financing needs would rise to $15.1 billion in 2018/2019 from $11.4 billion in the current financial year.But Iqbal said those risks would be countered by the economic boost the investment would give to industries such as steel, construction and engineering, pushing future annual growth to above 6 percent.In July the IMF upped its forecast for growth in Pakistan to 5 percent from 4.7 percent in the fiscal year to June 2017, citing China's investment plans.""As the economy grows, our capacity to undertake the responsibilities of repayments also improves, what really matters is that all of that investment is going into productive sectors,"" Iqbal said.Under CPEC, a number of new economic zones will be created along the corridor. Pakistan hopes that some industry will relocate from China, due to cheaper wages and production costs, Iqbal said.""Our preferred mode is joint ventures, because that will give a stake to both Pakistani and Chinese enterprises so now our government is actively promoting business-to-business links,"" he said.",11/24/2016,China to make extra 85 bn investments in Pakistan rail energy,business
