"TOKYO: Asian shares were on the defensive on Monday, undermined by fears that the strength in the U.S. dollar and rising U.S. bond yields since Donald Trump's election to president could accelerate fund outflows from emerging markets.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.1 percent, staying near four-month lows. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.3 percent as the yen continued to slip against the dollar.Trump's unexpected election victory has led to a major repricing of assets, with investors rushing to buy U.S. stocks and the dollar, while dumping bonds and emerging market assets.Carrying out even some of his plans for deregulation and tax cuts would undermine assumptions investors had long held - that the U.S. economy would grow modestly and inflation would remain tame in the foreseeable future.Trump's protectionism could hurt many of U.S. trade partners, including emerging markets which could see decline in exports to the U.S..To be sure, investors have little idea to what extent Trump can implement his proposals, including slapping tariffs on major trading partners such as China and Mexico and heavy tax cuts that would widen the U.S. fiscal deficit.Some investors think the market will have reality check as soon as differences between the new administration and Congress appear over some of Trump's policies.""Next week, we have events that would make investors more sober, such as OPEC meeting and Italian referendum. By then this Trump-inspired market may come to an end for now,"" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.Yet heightened uncertainty prompted investors to demand a larger premium for holding long-term U.S. debt, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield soaring to 2.364 percent by last week from around 1.86 percent before the elections.It last stood at 2.353 percent, with a rise above its 2015 peak of 2.5 percent seen as having potential to spark a further sell-off as bond prices fall.Higher U.S. yields are helping the dollar continue its bull run. The U.S. unit rose to as high as 111.125, its highest level since early June. It last stood at 110.865.It has risen almost 10 percent from its low of 101.19 hit on Nov 9, when markets initially took Trump's victory will trigger a rush to safer assets such as the yen.The euro traded $1.0589, having hit a near one-year low of $1.0569 on Friday.The Australian dollar hit 4 1/2-month low of $0.7315.The data from the U.S. financial watchdog showed on Friday that in the first week after the U.S. elections speculators hardly increased their net long positions in the dollar.""This suggests the leveraged fund community largely missed out on the dollar rally,"" analysts at ANZ Research wrote.Oil prices rose in early Monday trade after five-percent gains last week, their first weekly gains in about a month, on growing expectations that OPEC will find a way to cap production.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is moving closer to finalising its first deal since 2008 to limit output, with most members prepared to offer Iran flexibility on production volumes, ministers and sources said.Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose 1.1 percent to $47.35 per barrel.",11/21/2016,Asian shares on the defensive as US yields dollar ri,business

"PANAMA CITY: Panama can remain a competitive financial center while cracking down on tax evaders and other criminals who have used the country to launder money, according to the panel formed by the government after the ""Panama Papers"" scandal broke in April.</strongThe five-member ""Committee of Independent Experts"", including a former boss of the Panama Canal, said the country needs to get in line with United Nations transparency standards, adopt tougher anti-corruption legislation and tighten regulation of trusts.""The moment has come. The country can no longer postpone decision-making in this field,"" said the 23-page report released on Monday.A leak in April of more than 11.5 million documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, dubbed the Panama Papers, sparked outrage by showing how the rich in many countries go offshore to avoid paying taxes while working families pay theirs.""Panama is already acting on most of these issues, including strengthening the regulations that apply to trusts and aligning ourselves with international standards,"" Dulcidio de la Guardia, the country's economy minister, told Reuters in a telephone interview after the report was released.He said the budgets of financial regulatory agencies have already been raised as part of the effort.The report, which stressed the need for Panama to remain a magnet for banking and other service industries, calls for ""transparency in identifying the final beneficiary of legal and financial instrument"".This was a recommendation made by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and Swiss anti-corruption expert Mark Pieth, both of whom resigned from the panel in August, claiming that Panama would not promise to make its report public without first being vetted by the government.The official report went to President Juan Carlos Varela on Friday, before being released on Monday.Stiglitz and Pieth published findings of their own last week, saying that countries that fail to give up their secrecy jurisdictions should be cut off from the global financial system.The Panama Papers showed money was hidden in ways that law enforcement agencies could not detect. The culprits were not only tax dodgers, Stiglitz and Pieth said, but money launderers for a wide variety of criminal groups including a Russian child pornography ring.The official report calls for ""anti-corruption legislation that addresses acts performed by Panamanian nationals or economic groups established in Panama that directly or indirectly participate in the implementation of illegal activities in third countries.""",11/22/2016,Panama needs new anti corruption laws combat tax dodger,business
"TOKYO: Tokyo stocks opened flat on Tuesday as investors assessed the impact of a strong earthquake that triggered tsunamis along Japan´s northeast coast, although no major damage was immediately reported.</strongTokyo´s bellwether Nikkei index had risen to a 10-month high by Monday as the dollar soared against the yen on expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month.But the yen, which is often bought as a safe haven in time of uncertainty, strengthened Tuesday soon after the quake.""Stocks would have been off to a strong start but there´s a bit of a wait-and-see mode due to the earthquake,"" said Nobuyuki Fujimoto, a senior market analyst at SBI Securities Co.""Investors will eye news on the earthquake but as long as the damage isn´t extreme, there won´t be lasting impact on markets,"" he told Bloomberg News.The benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.09 percent, or 15.62 points, to 18,090.40 in the first few minutes of trading, while the Topix index of all first-section issues was up 0.04 percent, or 0.52 points, at 1,443.45.The dollar was trading at 110.60 yen Tuesday, compared with levels above 111 yen seen before the earthquake.A stronger yen is negative to the stock market as it eats into exporters´ profitability.A powerful 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit Japan´s northeast early Tuesday, triggering warnings of tsunami waves as high as three metres (10 feet) on the coast near the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant.Several tsunamis, the biggest measuring 1.4 metres (4.6 feet), were observed on the northeastern coast, according to NHK.One measuring one metre (3.3 feet) was recorded at the Fukushima plant but operator Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) said there were no reports of any problems as a result of the wave.Shares in TEPCO fell 1.17 percent to 422 yen in early trading.",11/22/2016,Tokyo stocks open flat after quake tsunami,business

Reuters commodities analyst Wang Tao said that Brent could rise to $49.85 per barrel, a level marked by several technical resistance factors.Despite Wednesday's slight increases, analysts said that the market was currently unwilling to push crude prices to $50 a barrel or higher.""The market seems unwilling to push oil towards $50 a barrel ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday tomorrow,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA brokerage in Singapore.

"TOKYO: Pakistan LNG Ltd has received strong interest in its tender to buy as many as 240 shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from suppliers hungry to sell gas in an oversupplied market, a senior official told Reuters on Thursday.</strongThe emergence of Pakistan as a large-scale buyer is a welcome boost in the market for the supercooled gas as demand slows in traditional big buyers like Japan. Spot Asian LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen by two-thirds since the beginning of 2014 as new supplies have flooded the market.Launched earlier this month, the tender for a combination of mid- and long-term shipments ""has been extremely well received,"" said Adnan Gilani, chief operating officer of state-owned Pakistan LNG.""The response is beyond what we thought,"" the executive said, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of an LNG conference in Tokyo. Gilani didn't identify any of the bidding suppliers.The company launched its tender to purchase a combined 240 shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG),The mid-term tender covers a period of five years and calls for 60 shipments, while the long-term tender is for 15 years and 180 cargoes, according to information presented in the tender documents released on the company's website earlier this month.More than 20 global oil and gas majors and traders attended a bidders conference held by Pakistan LNG two days ago, Gilani said, adding as many as 10 more expressed interest without attending. The deadline for bidding is Dec. 20, he said.Pakistan LNG will launch a new tender for 4.5 million tonnes of LNG ""within a few months"", and six months later it will seek bids for another 4.5 million tonnes, he said.By 2019 Pakistan, which can only meet two-thirds of its gas demand, expects to be importing about 23 million tonnes of LNG a year via five terminals to fuel power stations and vehicles.""We are buying for our baseload needs,"" he said.

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) completed the auction of all three licences for Pakistan’s first Direct to Home Service (DTH) after 15 hours of bidding in the wee hours of Thursday.</strongThe highest bid was raised by Mag Entertainment for Rs 4.91 billion, followed by M/s. Shahzad Sky for Rs 4.90 billion and M/s. Star time for Rs 4.89 billion respectively. A total of 11 companies — Orient Electronics Lahore, Mag Entertainment Lahore, Skyflix Islamabad, Smartimes Communications Islamabad, Sardar Builders Islamabad, Smart Sky Islamabad, Parus Media and Broadcast Islamabad, NayaTel Islamabad, Shahzad Sky, Islamabad, HB DTH Islamabad and IQ Communications Karachi — took part in the bidding process to secure the three licences.“All the three licences were sold for Rs 14.69 billion,” informed Chairman PEMRA Absar Alam, while speaking to the press.PEMRA Chairman congratulated the winning companies and said the initiative was going to be a game-changer for Pakistan’s electronic media industry.“To date, this is the biggest investment in Pakistan’s electronic media history,” he said and added as per the estimates and feasibility studies carried out by PEMRA experts, the overall investment would be $450 million ($150 million each) and could touch $750 million more in the next two years. These estimates did not include the bidding proceeds, he made it clear.The DTH service, he said, was a state-of-the art technology offering new dimensions of distribution system and a wide range of choice to consumers. “The current analogue distribution system is offering a maximum of 80 channels while the DTH would increase the capacity to around 120 and each local DTH licence holder is expected to have at least 500,000 subscribers,” said Absar Alam.Besides lucrative investment, the DTH regime would also make a significant contribution to job generation in the country leading to 15,000 jobs (5,000 by each company) i.e. new direct employment opportunities, he maintained.Absar Alam said the DTH service would not end the cable operators’ business, but would compel them to invest in technology and their distribution systems.However, the media watchdog issued non-exclusive licences for 15 years to the successful bidders after the open outcry bidding.Pakistani DTH services, once launched, will counter the sale of illegal Indian DTH services in Pakistan, which incur a heavy loss to the national exchequer because of transfer of between $200 million to $350 million to India annually on account of subscription fee. Now the legal DTH services will give consumers a choice against the current monopoly of cable operators as well.Pakistan has nearly 25 million electronic media subscribers and between three to five million consumers use Indian DTH illegally. After issuance of licences, subscribers of Indian DTH would have to shift to the local network.Similarly, foreign channels will get landing rights to come under the local regime through a regulatory process and launching of new local satellite channels will be allowed.The DTH licence holders will have to start operations within the year or risk termination of licences. The bidders are required to deposit 15 percent of the bid money at the outset of the bidding as earnest money, followed by 50 percent of the bid money upfront. The remaining amount could be paid immediately or in three yearly instalments at a mark-up rate.Each DTH licence holder is required to pay an annual fee of Rs10 million and contribute two percent of their gross revenue after the first three years of operations.Licenses to the bid winners would be awarded after clearance from the interior ministry and law enforcement agencies.",11/24/2016,Pakistans first DTH licences auctioned for Rs 1469 billi,business
"LONDON: Pakistan has secured an additional $8.5 billion of investment from Beijing as part of the countries' joint energy, transport and infrastructure plan, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Wednesday.</strongThat is on top of the $46-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, which focuses on road building and energy infrastructure to end chronic power shortages in Pakistan and to link China's landlocked north-west with the deep-water port Gwadar on the Arabian Sea.Some $4.5 billion of the additional investment will be spent on upgrading tracks and signaling on Pakistan's main railway line from Karachi to Peshawar and increase the speed on the line to 160 km per hour from the current 60-80 kph, Iqbal told Reuters in an interview.Another $4 billion will go toward an LNG terminal and transmission line, he added.""This has now all been approved, so this is an additional $8.5 billion to the $46 billion we had already, so we are now close to $55 billion,"" Iqbal said.The International Monetary Fund said in June that repayments and profit repatriation from large-scale investments such as CPEC could add to Pakistan's medium- and long-term risks, predicting that the country's gross external financing needs would rise to $15.1 billion in 2018/2019 from $11.4 billion in the current financial year.But Iqbal said those risks would be countered by the economic boost the investment would give to industries such as steel, construction and engineering, pushing future annual growth to above 6 percent.In July the IMF upped its forecast for growth in Pakistan to 5 percent from 4.7 percent in the fiscal year to June 2017, citing China's investment plans.""As the economy grows, our capacity to undertake the responsibilities of repayments also improves, what really matters is that all of that investment is going into productive sectors,"" Iqbal said.Under CPEC, a number of new economic zones will be created along the corridor. Pakistan hopes that some industry will relocate from China, due to cheaper wages and production costs, Iqbal said.""Our preferred mode is joint ventures, because that will give a stake to both Pakistani and Chinese enterprises so now our government is actively promoting business-to-business links,"" he said.",11/24/2016,China to make extra 85 bn investments in Pakistan rail energy,business

"BIRMINGHAM: Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali both scored dashing fifties as England wrested the initiative from Pakistan on the fourth day of the third Test at Edgbaston on Saturday.At stumps, England were 414 for five in their second innings, a lead of 311 runs.<br/> Bairstow was 82 not out and Ali 60 not out after they had added an unbroken 132 for the sixth wicket ahead of Sunday´s final day.Pakistan will now have to set a new record for the Birmingham ground if they are to go 2-1 up in the four-match series, as the most any side have made in the fourth innings to win a Test at Edgbaston is South Africa´s 283 for five in 2008.England had been well-placed at 120 without loss overnight. But openers Alastair Cook and Alex Hales both went early on Saturday as Pakistan took two wickets for no runs in nine balls.Joe Root (62) and James Vince (42) stopped the rot during a painstaking stand of 95.Leg-spinner Yasir Shah struck either side of tea to dismiss Root and Gary Ballance. But the pair´s Yorkshire colleague Bairstow, in at 257 for four, scored briskly and he received excellent support from Ali as they overpowered a tiring Pakistan attack featuring just four frontline bowlers.England scored 152 runs in Saturday´s final session, after managing 142 runs in the first two sessions combined.Play resumed Saturday with England captain Cook 64 not out and Hales 50 not out after they had erased a first-innings deficit of 103 with their maiden century stand in 18 innings as a Test-match opening pair. But Pakistan soon removed both batsmen.Left-hander Cook (66) pushed out to first-innings five-wicket hero Sohail Khan and a diving Shah held an excellent catch at point.Mohammad Amir then turned 126 for one into 126 for two when Hales (54) edged a seaming delivery from the left-arm quick and Younis Khan held a difficult low chance at second slip.Root, who made a Test-best 254 in England´s 330-run series-levelling win at Old Trafford, struck two superb fours off Sohail -- a back-foot force followed by a cover-drive.Root, however, had a reprieve on 25 when he edged Rahat Ali only for Mohammad Hafeez to drop the low, two-handed, chance at first slip.It was tough on left-arm paceman Rahat, who bowled superbly in reeling off five straight maidens in a spell of seven overs for just seven runs.After lunch, Root pulled Shah for a boundary that saw him to a 108-ball fifty.<br/> But Shah, bowling into the rough outside leg stump, had his revenge when Root, not for the first time this season, mistimed a sweep and gave a simple catch to Hafeez at short fine leg.Vince, yet to make a fifty in nine Test innings, had been composed in equalling his highest score at this level of 42. But he too fell in familiar fashion when, flirting outside off stump against the new ball, he wastefully guided Amir to second slip Younis.England, 262 for four at tea, lost Ballance (28) on 285 when Shah, bowling round the wicket, had the left-hander well caught by leg slip Asad Shafiq off a genuine glance. But Ali cover-drove Shah for four and, two balls later, he whipped him for another four wide of mid-on.Bairstow clipped Sohail off his pads and swept Shah for two well-struck fours on his way to a 69-ball fifty. Left-hander Ali, to chants of ´Moeen, Moeen Ali´ from a crowd of more than 15,500, followed Bairstow to the landmark in 64 balls. ",8/6/2016,England take 311 run lead against Pakistan at 4th day ,sports

"BULAWAYO: Opener Tom Latham scored his second consecutive century in Zimbabwe as New Zealand´s batsmen dominated the opening day of the second Test at Queens Sports Club on Saturday.Latham´s 105 set New Zealand up for a mammoth total and crushing victory in the first Test, and he bettered that score to give the Black Caps a commanding platform.The 24-year-old recorded his fifth Test century and went on to make 136, before succumbing to what proved to be the final ball of the day as New Zealand closed on 329 for two.Zimbabwe´s bowlers claimed just six wickets in a horribly one-sided first Test, and endured a similarly frustrating day on another docile pitch on Saturday.With the seamers lacking in pace, Latham and Martin Guptill had no trouble seeing off the new ball and went on to construct an opening stand of 169.Guptill was eventually dismissed in the hour before tea when Donald Tiripano snuck a straight delivery through his defences to trap him lbw for 87.But any joy for Zimbabwe was short-lived, as Latham went on to add 160 for the second wicket with Kane Williamson.Latham failed to see out the day when he was caught and bowled by left-arm spinner Sean Williams, but Williamson went to stumps unbeaten on 95, within touching distance of becoming the first New Zealand batsman to score a century against all nine Test nations.The day also saw Zimbabwe´s fans stage a peaceful protest against President Robert Mugabe´s government when they rose as one at the end of the 36th over to sing the national anthem.The number signified the number of years that Mugabe has been in power, and the action was initiated by the #ThisFlag citizen movement that has brought stayaways and public demonstrations across the country over the past six weeks.<br/> Their call to action drew the biggest crowd that Queens had seen during the series. ",8/6/2016,Latham ton helps Black Caps dominate Zimbab,sports
"BIRMINGHAM: Pakistan´s Yasir Shah took the key wicket of Joe Root as England found runs hard to come by on the fourth day of the third Test at Edgbaston on Saturday.At tea, England were 262 for four in their second innings -- a lead of 159 runs -- after losing both Root (62) and James Vince (42).Root´s Yorkshire team-mates Gary Ballance (21 not out) and Jonny Bairstow (two not out) were unbeaten after a session where England managed just 79 runs in 26 overs.With the four-match series all square at 1-1, England resumed on 120 without loss, 17 runs in front.Alastair Cook, the England captain, was 64 not out and Alex Hales 50 not out after they had erased a first-innings deficit of 103 with their maiden century stand in 18 innings as a Test-match opening pair.But Pakistan removed both batsmen inside Saturday´s first five overs during a dramatic burst of two wickets for no runs in nine balls.Left-hander Cook (66) pushed out to Sohail Khan and a diving Shah held an excellent catch at point.Mohammad Amir then turned England´s 126 for one into 126 for two when Hales (54) edged a seaming delivery from the left-arm quick and Younis Khan held a difficult low chance going to his right at second slip.Root, who made a Test-best 254 in England´s 330-run series-levelling win at Old Trafford, countered with two superb fours in four balls off Sohail -- a back-foot force followed by a cover-drive.The latter shot has often proved Vince´s undoing in his brief Test career.But it is also one of the Hampshire batsman´s best strokes and it enabled him to get off the mark with a stylish four off Amir.Root, however, had a reprieve on 25 when he edged Rahat Ali only for Mohammad Hafeez to drop the low, two-handed, chance at first slip.It was tough on left-arm quick Rahat, who reeled off five successive maidens in a probing spell of seven overs costing just seven runs.At lunch, England were 183 for two -- a lead of 80 runs.<br/> After the interval, Root pulled leg-spinner Shah for a boundary that saw him to a 108-ball fifty with his sixth four.Vince followed up with a fine leg glance for four off Shah.Sohail, altering his line, almost got Root to play on.But it was Shah, bowling into the rough outside leg stump, who made the breakthrough.Root, not for the first time this season, mistimed a sweep and gave a simple catch to Hafeez at short fine leg.Root´s exit ended a stand of 95 in 36 overs with Vince that had taken England to 221 for three.Vince, yet to make a fifty in nine Test innings, had been composed in equalling his highest score at this level of 42.But he too fell in familiar fashion when, flirting outside off stump against the new ball, he guided Amir to second slip Younis with the kind of shot usually reserved for coaches giving fielding practice.",8/6/2016,Yasir Shah strikes as England lose R,sports
"BULAWAYO: Hundreds of protestors waved Zimbabwe´s national flag and sang the national anthem during a cricket match against New Zealand on Saturday, in a sign of mounting opposition to President Robert Mugabe.Circumventing laws which forbid political gatherings without police clearance, protestors at the ground in Bulawayo, the country´s second largest city, rose at the 36th over and began singing the national anthem while waving the national flag,which has been turned into a symbol of protest.""I am in complete support of the protest because of the situation in the country,"" activist Mandla Dungeni told AFP.""We need to get the message across that it´s time up, using whatever means available to us. There will be more of these and I am certain they will have the desired impact.""A woman who asked to be identified as Rose said: ""It´s difficult to fend for ourselves let alone send our kids to school. It´s not a secret that this government has failed. That is why you are seeing all these people gathered here are concerned about how things are.""Pastor Evan Mawarire who called for a national strike last month which shut down businesses and schools and paralysed the public transport system was behind the protest, according to a video he posted on Facebook.Police had earlier arrested at least 10 members of the pressure group Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) who staged a protest outside the venue of the Test match calling on Mugabe to fix the ailing economy or step down.""Mugabe Must Go"" one placard read, and another protestor called for resistance to a government plan to introduce token bank notes to ease cash shortages. The demonstration was dispersed by mounted police.After 36 years of Mugabe´s authoritarian rule, Zimbabwe has seen a rise in opposition protests fuelled by internet activism using the hashtag ""ThisFlag"" - a reference to wearing the national flag in public.On Wednesday hundreds of protestors held a march in the capital calling on 92-year-old Mugabe to step down over worsening economic troubles which have seen banks running short of cash and the government failing to pay its workers on time.Three weeks ago, Zimbabwe´s independence war veterans, who had been loyal allies of Mugabe, issued a strongly-worded statement calling on him to step down.Despite his advanced age, the president has fought back, vowing to crack down on leaders of the protests.The ruling party on Thursday expelled four war veterans suspected to be behind the criticism. ",8/6/2016,Zimbabweans against government and cricket match against New Zealand,sports
