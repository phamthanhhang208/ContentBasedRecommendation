"ZURICH: Switzerland's highest court has ordered Israel to pay Iran around $1.1 billion plus interest in a decades-old dispute over a secretive oil pipeline company predating the 1979 Islamic revolution which made the countries enemies.</strongThe Swiss Federal Tribunal rejected an appeal, citing lack of due process, against an arbitration ruling last year. The verdict, dated June 27, was available on the Lausanne court's website.It also awarded Iran 450,000 Swiss francs ($461,302) in court costs and lawyer fees.It remains unclear whether Israel will pay up given restrictions its ""trading with the enemy"" laws.Lawyers for each side had been locked in an arbitration over the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC), a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil to the Mediterranean.For a decade, the pipeline successfully carried oil from the Red Sea for export to Europe. But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC. By December 1969 the pipeline was ready to handle 60 million tons of crude a year, though it never reached that level.A decade later Iran's Shah was ousted and the partners in EAPC became enemies overnight.Lawyers for both countries have declined to comment.Case number: 4A_322/2015 ($1 = 0.9755 Swiss francs)",8/11/2016,Swiss court backs Iran decades old oil row Isr,business

"SEOUL: At an Innisfree cosmetics store in Seoul's popular Myeongdong shopping district, a saleswoman helps 21-year-old Chinese tourist Yang Hui carry her shopping baskets to the pay desk in front of a large display showing K-Pop star Yoona</.""There's a lot to choose from,"" said Yang, confessing to having bought more than she'd planned from the store's range of around 900 products.South Korea's top cosmetics company Amorepacific Group (002790.KS) launches some 400 new Innisfree branded products a year, about half of which are no longer available a year later.It's one of dozens of Korean mass cosmetics brands with a short product development cycle - a ""fast beauty"" approach that is increasingly popular among Chinese and other Asian millennials, gaining exposure in the United States and Europe, and attracting high-profile foreign investment.South Korea has become a hot-bed for applying to cosmetics the ""fast fashion"" principles of shifting designs quickly from catwalk to Main Street to capitalise on new trends.Thousands of small cosmetics firms compete to get their new products to market, with third-party manufacturers cutting the time on testing and recipe alignment and providing the capacity for swift market launch.Korean brands have cut product development cycles to as little as four months, compared to over a year for global brands, industry experts say.""When we received an eyeshadow order from a major global client in 2004, it took us two years to begin production. Now it takes us one year from the word go,"" said Lim Dae-gyu, a director at Cosmax Inc (192820.KS), a cosmetics manufacturer with annual sales of close to $500 million.""For South Korean mass brands, it takes less - just 4-6 months from planning to market launch is average,"" Lim added.WINNING FORMULA</strongSouth Korea last year overtook the United States and Japan to become the No. 2 cosmetics exporter to China after France. It shipped $1.1 billion worth of skincare creams, facial masks, compacts and other cosmetic products to the world's second-largest economy, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.South Korea's total cosmetics exports were worth $2.59 billion, up 44 percent from 2014, with Hong Kong and the United States its second- and third-biggest markets, a long way behind China.Sales are boosted by South Korea's duty-free market - the world's biggest - which caters especially to big-spending Chinese tourists. Cosmetics accounted for nearly half of the country's record duty-free revenue of 5.8 trillion won ($5.1 billion) in the first half of this year, customs data showed.The trade is not without its downside. To counter unofficial re-sales, Korea's Customs Service is considering setting a 50 product limit for duty-free buyers, a customs official said. Analysts say this could dent sales by smaller firms, but note that bigger companies already limit duty-free purchases to control store inventory.""New ingredients, new packaging, new formulas come on the market continuously, and when something does well Korean brands respond quickly,"" said Jang Jun-kee, managing director of the Korea Cosmetics Foundation, an industry group.Amorepacific's 2008 hit product, the cushion compact - a multifunctional sponge applicator for anything from liquid facial cover and sun protection to make-up base and moisturiser - inspired follow-up products from global brands such as L'Oreal's (OREP.PA) Lancome and Estee Lauder's (EL.N) Clinique.Innovative, often cute, packaging also helps.The Face Shop, a mass brand from South Korea's second-ranked cosmetics firm LG Household &amp; Health Care (051900.KS), said last month it sold out of its initial 130,000 cushion compacts featuring Disney characters - costing 20,000 won ($17.82) - in just two days. It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products ""BB cream"" and ""CC cream"", South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products.""Korean consumers are very sophisticated. Their interest in beauty and expectations of cosmetics are high and they are willing to try new concepts,"" L'Oreal Korea said in emailed comments to Reuters. ""It's a market where new trends emerge before potentially going global.""CHINA FOUNDATION</strongFor foreign investors, buying into the Korean success story is a convenient way also into China, where locals can't get enough of Korean TV dramas and K-Pop music.""We find beauty and media-entertainment sectors to be the most exciting (in Korea),"" said Ravi Thakran, the chairman and managing partner at L Capital Asia, a unit of LVMH (LVMH.PA), which last month became a major shareholder in South Korean colour cosmetics brand CLIO. ""The popularity of Korean culture such as K-Pop, dramas and celebrities boosted significant demand for Korean beauty products in China and other Southeast Asian countries,"" he added.Beyond China, Korean cosmetics have also moved into chains including LVMH's Sephora, Target (TGT.N) and Urban Outfitters (URBN.O), according to Korea's state-run trade agency KOTRA.The LVMH unit's investment in CLIO came just weeks after Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Bain Capital Private Equity said they were buying a majority stake in unlisted cosmetics maker Carver Korea Co Ltd.($1 = 1,107.9000 won)",8/4/2016,Fast beauty Korean cosmetics shine China draw investor,business
"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has announced it will release the last instalment of a $6.6 billion economic bailout package to Pakistan, as Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif hailed an end to the country´s reliance on the lender.</strongThe decision to release the final tranche worth $102 million of the three-year programme came after a review of the country´s economic performance that found it was meeting most reform indicators but still needed to broaden the tax net.IMF delegation head Harald Finger said growth was projected to reach five percent supported by a construction boom linked to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, an ambitious infrastructure upgrade project intended to link China´s western Xinjiang region to Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea.""All indicative targets and structural benchmarks (SB) were met, except for the delayed notification of multi-year tariffs for three power distribution companies,"" Finger said Thursday in Dubai, referring to measures intended to reduce major fluctuations in electricity costs.The release of the final tranche is subject to approval by the IMF´s executive board though that is considered a formality.In Islamabad, Sharif told lawmakers from his party that his government had ended the country´s reliance on foreign multilateral assistance and was saying ""goodbye"" to the Fund.""With the grace of God, we will say goodbye to IMF after this (agreement),"" he said.Sharif had been under pressure from the opposition for seeking the loan in 2013 because its conditions included forcing the government to raise taxes and energy prices.The IMF note cautioned however that to consolidate and reinforce the gains achieved in the last three years, it was important to ""strengthen public finances and external buffers, broaden the tax net, (and) improve public financial management,"" among other measures.",8/5/2016,IMF release final instalment 66 bn loan Paki,business

"SEOUL: At an Innisfree cosmetics store in Seoul's popular Myeongdong shopping district, a saleswoman helps 21-year-old Chinese tourist Yang Hui carry her shopping baskets to the pay desk in front of a large display showing K-Pop star Yoona</.""There's a lot to choose from,"" said Yang, confessing to having bought more than she'd planned from the store's range of around 900 products.South Korea's top cosmetics company Amorepacific Group (002790.KS) launches some 400 new Innisfree branded products a year, about half of which are no longer available a year later.It's one of dozens of Korean mass cosmetics brands with a short product development cycle - a ""fast beauty"" approach that is increasingly popular among Chinese and other Asian millennials, gaining exposure in the United States and Europe, and attracting high-profile foreign investment.South Korea has become a hot-bed for applying to cosmetics the ""fast fashion"" principles of shifting designs quickly from catwalk to Main Street to capitalise on new trends.Thousands of small cosmetics firms compete to get their new products to market, with third-party manufacturers cutting the time on testing and recipe alignment and providing the capacity for swift market launch.Korean brands have cut product development cycles to as little as four months, compared to over a year for global brands, industry experts say.""When we received an eyeshadow order from a major global client in 2004, it took us two years to begin production. Now it takes us one year from the word go,"" said Lim Dae-gyu, a director at Cosmax Inc (192820.KS), a cosmetics manufacturer with annual sales of close to $500 million.""For South Korean mass brands, it takes less - just 4-6 months from planning to market launch is average,"" Lim added.WINNING FORMULA</strongSouth Korea last year overtook the United States and Japan to become the No. 2 cosmetics exporter to China after France. It shipped $1.1 billion worth of skincare creams, facial masks, compacts and other cosmetic products to the world's second-largest economy, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.South Korea's total cosmetics exports were worth $2.59 billion, up 44 percent from 2014, with Hong Kong and the United States its second- and third-biggest markets, a long way behind China.Sales are boosted by South Korea's duty-free market - the world's biggest - which caters especially to big-spending Chinese tourists. Cosmetics accounted for nearly half of the country's record duty-free revenue of 5.8 trillion won ($5.1 billion) in the first half of this year, customs data showed.The trade is not without its downside. To counter unofficial re-sales, Korea's Customs Service is considering setting a 50 product limit for duty-free buyers, a customs official said. Analysts say this could dent sales by smaller firms, but note that bigger companies already limit duty-free purchases to control store inventory.""New ingredients, new packaging, new formulas come on the market continuously, and when something does well Korean brands respond quickly,"" said Jang Jun-kee, managing director of the Korea Cosmetics Foundation, an industry group.Amorepacific's 2008 hit product, the cushion compact - a multifunctional sponge applicator for anything from liquid facial cover and sun protection to make-up base and moisturiser - inspired follow-up products from global brands such as L'Oreal's (OREP.PA) Lancome and Estee Lauder's (EL.N) Clinique.Innovative, often cute, packaging also helps.The Face Shop, a mass brand from South Korea's second-ranked cosmetics firm LG Household &amp; Health Care (051900.KS), said last month it sold out of its initial 130,000 cushion compacts featuring Disney characters - costing 20,000 won ($17.82) - in just two days. It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products ""BB cream"" and ""CC cream"", South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products.""Korean consumers are very sophisticated. Their interest in beauty and expectations of cosmetics are high and they are willing to try new concepts,"" L'Oreal Korea said in emailed comments to Reuters.

"ZURICH: Switzerland's highest court has ordered Israel to pay Iran around $1.1 billion plus interest in a decades-old dispute over a secretive oil pipeline company predating the 1979 Islamic revolution which made the countries enemies.</strongThe Swiss Federal Tribunal rejected an appeal, citing lack of due process, against an arbitration ruling last year. The verdict, dated June 27, was available on the Lausanne court's website.It also awarded Iran 450,000 Swiss francs ($461,302) in court costs and lawyer fees.It remains unclear whether Israel will pay up given restrictions its ""trading with the enemy"" laws.Lawyers for each side had been locked in an arbitration over the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC), a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil to the Mediterranean.For a decade, the pipeline successfully carried oil from the Red Sea for export to Europe. But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC. By December 1969 the pipeline was ready to handle 60 million tons of crude a year, though it never reached that level.A decade later Iran's Shah was ousted and the partners in EAPC became enemies overnight.Lawyers for both countries have declined to comment.Case number: 4A_322/2015 ($1 = 0.9755 Swiss francs)",8/11/2016,Swiss court backs Iran decades old oil row Isr,business

The board would then make cross check to ensure that no under voicing and flying invoicing has been included for the purpose of tax evasion, he told APP.He was of the view that FBR had been facing such problems for a long time and it was after long consideration that this software has been developed to overcome the problems.He said that before launching the software the FBR had launched a pilot project and approached businessmen and chambers to inform them and create awareness among them regarding the system.The member ST FBR said that similar systems have been developed to check sales tax evasion by vendors and electricity distribution companies (Discos) all across the country.In future two more software are being developed to introduce same facility in the real estate business and motor registration system.He said that the FBR has taken many incentives to revamp the existing sales tax system to facilitate taxpayers and also improve revenue collection system by making it taxpayer friendly transparent and disciplined.Meanwhile the FBR and Auditor General for Pakistan Revenues (AGPR) have joined hands to check tax evasions of billions of rupees by monitoring sale and purchase activities of government vendors.The FBR in collaboration with AGPR has put a mechanism in place to monitor and access complete data of sale and purchase of government vendors through Monitoring and Invoice Verification System in order to check almost 80 percent of the sales tax evasion by the vendors, a senior official of the board told APP.As per the common practice the government vendors were filing only one fifth of the sales tax on Sales Tax Return Number (STRN) with Accountant General Office (AG) on their own while evading 80 percent government tax due to non availability of the STN verification facility at AGP.The purpose is to check the malpractice that has been inflicting huge loss to national exchequer in terms of tax evasion adding that with this system the cross verification of the STRN of all the vendors working with government could be verified.The FBR would also involve District Controller Accounts for properly accessing the data of the government vendors and contractors and ask them for filing of 80 percent sales tax account in order to recover huge amount evaded in terms of the sales tax.",8/12/2016,Sales Tax initiatives check huge tax evasi,business

"LONDON: From computers and cars to carpets and food, Britain´s decision to leave the EU is beginning to hit consumers in the pocket, having already spread uncertainty through the property market.</strongThe consequences of the shock vote have so far been mainly theoretical, but recent data suggest that the country´s tumbling currency is about to reach the High Street.The pound has lost 10 to 15 percent of its value against the euro and the dollar since the June 23 referendum, raising the price of goods primarily supplied by foreign companies such as automobiles, computers, clothing and some foods.Carmaker Peugeot told AFP that it had raised prices by an average of two percent since August 1 for models of its three flagship brands: Peugeot, Citroen and DS.Similarly, Dell computer group said it now had to factor the cost of components, denominated in dollars, into the price of its products in Britain.British group Headlam explained that the pound´s plunge had also increased the cost of its domestic floor coverings, imported mainly from Belgium and the Netherlands, by around six percent.All eyes are now turning to food and property, which have been relatively unscathed, but which many fear could see similar price fluctuations.Fierce competition among supermarkets desperate to maintain market share normally provides a bulwark against sharp inflation in food prices, but Brexit could rewrite the rules, said Fraser McKevitt, an analyst at Kantar group´s London office.""We wouldn´t expect to see anything come through immediately, but if sterling does remain weak, we are likely to see impact on some prices,"" he told AFP.""Around 40 percent of food in the UK is imported.""- Diluted purchasing power -</strongPrice comparison website mysupermarket.com has already reported an increase of one percent in the price of an average basket of supermarket goods in July, blaming ""fears of Brexit"" for the second consecutive month of price hikes.There are also fears over the UK housing market, but deflation is more of a concern than price rises in this key sector.Figures released Monday showed that residential rents for new lets in London had fallen for the first time in six years, according to the first study published on the issue since Britain voted to leave the European Union.While good news for tenants, it will leave landlords worse off.In addition, homeowners have seen the value of their property rise on average by just 2.1 percent in the year up tol August, a slowdown from the breakneck growth of recent years, according to property website Rightmove.Despite Brexit´s tremors being felt in the economy, official figures do not yet reveal wild price fluctuations, reporting only a slight rise in inflation of 0.6 percent in July.But experts expect stronger inflation growth over the next few months, boosted by the increased costs of imported goods and more volatile goods such as alcoholic drinks.The Bank of England has also deployed monetary weapons in an attempt to stop the economy sliding into recession, which are expected to increase the money supply and as a result boost inflation and further weaken the pound.Britons hoping for a pay rise to compensate for increased costs are likely to be disappointed, according to analysts.""It looks probable that consumer purchasing power will be significantly diluted over the coming months as inflation trends higher and earnings growth is limited,"" warned Howard Archer from IHS Global Insight.""Companies may well look to clamp down on workers´ pay as they strive to save costs in a more difficult environment.""Workers lucky enough to see a rise in their salary thanks to a fall in low-skilled immigration are unlikely to enjoy a marked increase in living standards due to the general slowdown of the post-Brexit economy, a report published by the Resolution Foundation said Tuesday.",8/17/2016,British shoppers begin feel post Brexit pi,business

"ROME: Anyone with internet access and a passion for seafood will soon be able to track commercial fishing trawlers all over the world, with a new tool that its developers hope will help end the overfishing that has decimated the world's fish stocks.</strongMillions of people depend on fish to survive, and fish will be vital to feeding the world's growing population that is predicted to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, the United Nations says.But overfishing has diminished fish stocks, and illicit fishing is threatening people's access to food in many poor countries, according to the United Nations.""We currently have around 450 million people globally who get their primary source of food from the ocean. This is 450 million meals a day under threat,"" said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe on Wednesday.""To solve the overfishing problem, including illegal fishing, we want to create transparency in the oceans,"" Gustavsson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Madrid.Oceana, an international conservation organisation, together with Google and SkyTruth, a nonprofit group that uses aerial and satellite images to track changes in the landscape, are due to launch the Global Fishing Tracker within weeks.The public, non-governmental organisations and local authorities will be able to use it to monitor coastlines and marine conservation areas, follow individual boats in near real-time and track what boats of a particular flag are doing.It will be especially useful for countries like Madagascar which have few resources to patrol and monitor their own coastlines, Oceana said.""You can slice that piece of data in many different ways which we think will be helpful when it comes to law enforcement, increasing public understanding, and catching the kind of people who are doing stuff they shouldn't be doing,"" said Gustavsson.Some 30 percent of fish stocks were overfished in 2013, up from 10 percent in 1974.

"MUMBAI: Indian gold refiners just months ago were ramping up capacity and struggling to secure enough ore from miners. Now, they are suspending operations as a surge in smuggled bullion wipes out wafer thin margins.</strongGold importing banks and big jewelers have also been hit by the growing entry of illicit gold, which avoids import duties and makes its way on to the so-called ""grey market"" where it is sold to end-users at a discount.Smuggled gold could account for more than a third of demand this year in India - the world's second-biggest buyer of the metal after China - potentially costing the government over $1 billion in lost revenue.The upsurge will lead to pressure for a reduction in the 10 percent import duty and a rethink on recently introduced levies on gold jewelry, which critics say are boosting the unofficial trade the government has been trying to curb.""Gold refiners have less than a 1 percent margin. If smugglers offer 4 or 5 percent discounts, then we have no choice but to close our operations,"" James Jose, secretary of the Association of Gold Refineries and Mints told Reuters.All 32 refineries in the country have stopped buying dore - a semi-pure alloy made by miners - in the past few months and are relying on treating scrap gold until market conditions normalize, he said.""Last fiscal year we refined 120 tonnes of gold. With local scrap supplies we can produce 20 tonnes of refined gold in the current year,"" said Rajesh Khosla, managing director of MMTC-PAMP India, the country's biggest refinery.SMUGGLING GROWS</strongIndia raised the duty on gold imports to 10 percent three years ago, aiming to dampen buying and narrow the current account deficit in a country where gold is seen as a store of wealth for rich and poor alike.Smugglers evade the duty and offer cheap gold to buyers such as bullion dealers and small jewelers, who can pay up to $100 an ounce below official domestic prices, currently around $1,340 an ounce.Falling gold prices deterred the illicit trade last year but smuggling has surged in recent months amid rising prices and the reintroduction in March of a 1 percent local sales tax on gold jewelry.Smuggled gold into India could double to as much as 300 tonnes in 2016, said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director at All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation, although the World Gold Council (WGC) has put the figure at 160 tonnes. At 300 tonnes, the government would forego about $1.3 billion at current gold prices.The new sales tax has encouraged smaller jewelers in particular to buy on the grey market, said Somasundaram PR, managing director of the WGCs' Indian operations. The jewelry must be sold without receipts, but goes to customers looking to hide funds from the authorities.The finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on gold smuggling.BANKS HIT</strongThe legal trade is also facing headwinds from a 26 percent rise in the gold price this year which has discouraged overall buying and made smuggled gold available at deep discounts.India's official gold imports fell 57 percent in the first seven months of 2016 to 215 tonnes, and could fall more than 60 percent for the year to 350 tonnes to 400 tonnes, the lowest level in two decades, said Sunil Kashyap, managing director, Global Banking and Markets at Scotiabank.Banks, which until last year were the main source of gold supply, are losing their market share quickly.""Since there were hefty discounts in the grey market, consumers shifted from banks to grey markets,"" Arindam Sarkar, senior vice president at Axis Bank, the biggest bullion importing bank in the country, told Reuters.""So far in 2016 our bullion business is down nearly 75 percent,"" he said.Bigger, more reputable jewelers are also suffering.""Small jewelers buy gold at 4 or 5 percent discount and then sell jewelry at 1 or 2 percent discount,"" said Aditya Pethe, a director at Waman Hari Pethe Jewellers in Mumbai.""The business of big jewelers like us is getting affected.But jewelers buying from the grey market say they have little choice.""I wasn't buying gold from grey market for months, but others were buying and doing business,"" said a Mumbai-based jeweler, who declined to be identified.""In the last two months I've also started buying as I have to survive.

"PARIS: Militant attacks, strikes and floods kept foreign tourists away from the French capital in the first half of the year and cost the Paris region tourism industry some 750 million euros ($849.38 million) in lost revenue, officials said on Tuesday.</strong""It's time to realise that the tourism sector is going through an industrial disaster.

"NEW YORK: A scandal involving the alleged sale of falsely labeled Egyptian cotton products by an Indian textile manufacturer to U.S. big box retailers highlights a stiff reality facing the high-end fiber market: there isn't much Egyptian cotton any more.</strongThe shortage of cotton from Egypt, which commands a premium due to its superior quality, creates an incentive to blend it with other types of cotton without disclosing it or to counterfeit the label altogether, cotton traders said, exacerbating a problem that has plagued the industry for years.Welspun India has lost 42 percent of its market value in the three days since Target Corp said it would sever ties with the textile manufacturer, one of the world's largest, accusing it of substituting cheaper, non-Egyptian cotton into sheets and pillowcases.Egyptian cotton is prized because much of it is ""long staple"" or ""extra long staple,"" meaning the length of the cotton fibers is longer, resulting in a finer, lighter more durable fabric and longer-lasting, higher-end clothing.While other countries including the United States and Australia produce larger quantities of high-end cotton than Egypt, cotton from the North African country has retained its prestige because of a long history growing the crop.But Egypt's cotton output has been declining for the past decade after farmers failed to adapt to shifting consumer demand for mass-produced items made from short- or medium-staple fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The decline has become a full-fledged crisis in recent years after the government removed cash subsidies, and many farmers replaced cotton acreage with rice, the USDA said.Egypt will produce just 160,000 480-lb bales of cotton in 2016/17, down from 1.4 million bales as recently as 2004/05, accounting for less than 0.2 percent of expected global output.This means some products marketed as containing Egyptian cotton almost certainly do not, or are blended with other types of cotton without proper disclosure, said Jordan Lea, chairman and co-owner of cotton merchant Eastern Trading in Greenville, South Carolina.""If you look at the volume of Egyptian goods that are for sale, and you look at the volume of Egyptian cotton that's produced, it would lead one to scratch one's head,"" Lea said.A GOLD SEAL?</strongLong and extra long staple cotton is rare - it makes up just 2.5 percent of annual world cotton production of more than 100 million bales, according to the USDA - and trades at a substantial premium.U.S. extra long staple cotton, or ""pima,"" trades for 152.25 cents per lb, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data, a 125 percent premium over cotton prices on ICE Futures U.S., a contract that accepts cotton of a ""strict low middling staple length"".Ron Lawson, a cotton industry veteran and broker with LOGIC Advisors in Sonoma, California, said he had ""no idea"" what Egyptian cotton prices were, which he said showed how much of a ""novelty"" item the fiber was.Improper labeling of cotton products including clothing and bedding is a violation of the U.S. Textile Act and Rules, which are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).An FTC spokesman declined to comment on whether the agency was aware of Target's allegations or had started an investigation.Egypt's cotton association appears to be aware of widespread counterfeiting. In April, its executive director told trade publication Home and Textiles Today that it had tested retail products labeled 'Egyptian cotton' and found that 90 percent contained no Egyptian cotton at all.The Cotton Egypt Association lists Welspun as one of just three companies permitted to label its products with the association's ""Gold Seal,"" which was launched earlier this year and is meant to ensure authenticity.Mukesh Saviani, a Welspun executive, told the trade publication in February that the seal was ""an assurance to retailers that they will not get into any compliance issues.""The scandal could leave big box U.S. retailers wary of dealing with products labeled Egyptian cotton, potentially providing a boon to growers of U.S. Pima cotton in places like California and Arizona.""The Supima boys are doing backflips and pirouettes on their desks right now,"" Lawson said, referring to an association that provides a trademark indicating cotton products come from 100 percent American Pima cotton.",8/25/2016,Welspun scandal plummeting Egyptian cotton outpu,business

"LONDON: Gold slid to a near five-week low on Monday after comments from top Federal Reserve officials fuelled speculation that U.S. interest rates would rise sooner rather than later, boosting the dollar.</strongSpeaking at a meeting of leading central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Fed chair Janet Yellen said on Friday that an improvement in the economy and the labour market in recent months had boosted the case for hiking rates.The CME Group's FedWatch tool showed the market pricing in more than a 30 percent chance of a hike in September, up from 18 percent before Yellen and her deputy Stanley Fischer spoke.Spot gold touched its lowest since July 26 at $1,314.70, and was down 0.1 percent at $1,319.81 an ounce at 1135 GMT. U.S. gold futures for December delivery were down $2.80 an ounce at $1,323.10.Gold whipsawed on Friday, rising as much as 1.5 percent in the immediate wake of Yellen's comments, before slipping back to end the day marginally lower.""The market was surprised (by Yellen) -- that is why it went all the way up first, before losing it all,"" Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS in Switzerland, said. ""The demand for physical (gold) is still very poor, so it feels like we may need to test lower levels first before a surge in price.""Gold's volatility tracked fluctuations in the dollar. The U.S. currency gave up gains soon after Yellen spoke as she gave no indication that a rate hike was imminent, but rebounded as traders reassessed her words, and after Fed Vice Chair Fischer said the Fed was still on track to lift rates this year.Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.""The pressure on gold will likely increase as we go into September, as participants are now more willing to bet on a rate hike given what they have gleaned from top Fed officials on Friday,"" INTL FCStone said in a note.Hedge funds and money managers increased their net long position in COMEX gold contracts in the week to Aug. 23, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed on Friday.Silver was little changed at $18.61 an ounce, having earlier touched its lowest in more than eight weeks at $18.36 an ounce.Platinum, the biggest faller among the major precious metals last week, was up 1 percent at $1,077.60 an ounce, while palladium was down 0.2 percent at $684.38 an ounce.",8/29/2016,Gold hits near 5 week low after Fed strikes hawkish ,business
"BEIJING: China is hoping to cement its standing as a global power when it hosts leaders from the world's biggest economies this weekend, but suspects the West and its allies will try to deny Beijing what it sees as its rightful place on the international stage.</strongEnsuring that this does not happen will be one of President Xi Jinping's priorities, and a key mark of how successful China will judge the G20 summit to be.Beijing wants to use the Sept 4-5 meeting in the tourist hub of Hangzhou to lay out a broad strategy for global growth, but talks are likely to be overshadowed by arguments over everything from territorial disputes to protectionism, diplomats said.""From where China sits, it looks like the Americans are trying to encircle them,"" said a senior Western envoy, describing conversations with Chinese officials ahead of G20 as being dominated by the South China Sea row and an advanced U.S. anti-missile system to be deployed in South Korea.In recent months, China has been incensed by a ruling against its claims in the South China Sea by an international court, a case initiated by Manila but blamed by Beijing on Washington.While China wants to make sure its highest profile event of the year goes off successfully, Xi will be under pressure at home to ensure he is strong in the face of challenges to his authority on issues like the South China Sea, going by reports in state media.China has already made clear it does not want such matters overshadowing the meeting, which will be attended by U.S. President Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and other world leaders.State media has given great play to the idea that G20 is for China to show leadership in shaping global governance rules and forging ahead with sustainable global growth, with the official People's Daily saying this could be one of the G20's most fruitful ever get-togethers.""Let's make cooperation ever higher,"" it wrote in a commentary last week.But the state-run Study Times wrote in mid-August that Western countries were trying to deliberately exclude a rising China and deny it a proper voice on the world stage with schemes like the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership.""Trying to get back their right to global governance, they are forging a new 'sacred alliance', striving to establish new rules,"" the influential paper, published twice a week by the Central Party School, wrote in a G20 commentary.""These new rules will exclude China.""ANGERED BY BRITAIN, AUSTRALIA</strongOverseas, China has been angered by questions raised by Britain and Australia over strategic Chinese investments in their countries, saying it smacks of protectionism and paranoia.Australia has blocked the A$10 billion ($7.7 billion) sale of the country's biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders, while Britain has delayed a $24 billion Chinese-invested nuclear project.But Western officials have their own concerns about access for their companies in China and are increasingly not afraid to talk about it.Joerg Wuttke, the President of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said there has been a change in tone as European officials having been expressing more dissatisfaction with China's overcapacity problems and a lack of reciprocal market access for European companies. ""It has reached the point where people are not afraid to speak up any more. They feel like they have to be tougher in front of their own constituencies,"" Wuttke told Reuters.A European official involved in trade issues with China expressed exasperation at China's attitude on protectionism.""The Chinese would shut you down at once if you said you wanted to buy one of their grids. You wouldn't get to the end of the sentence,"" the official added.None of this will make for plain sailing at G20.""China is angry with almost everyone at the moment,"" said a second Beijing-based Western diplomat familiar with the summit.To be sure, China does want G20 to go smoothly, said a third Western diplomat.""It's very important from the stance of national pride,"" said the diplomat, pointing out it was not uncommon for G20s to be hijacked by issues other than economics.""It's a minefield for China.""JAPAN WORRIES</strongThen there is Japan, a country with which China has been embroiled in disputes for much of the last decade over their wartime past and a spat over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.Last week, China's top diplomat called on Japan to be ""constructive"" at G20, with the deeper fear in Beijing that Japan is angling to become involved in the South China Sea dispute as well, at the behest of its ally the United States.Wang Youming, the head of the developing countries program at the Foreign Ministry-backed China Institute of International Studies, wrote in the widely-read Chinese tabloid the Global Times that the closer G20 got, the more Japan was trying to cause trouble.""Japan is getting entangled in the South and East China Sea issues, cozying up to the Philippines, and urging China to respect the result of the so-called 'arbitration' case,"" Wang wrote.""Japan is up to its old tricks, and it's hard not to think they are trying to mess things up.""",8/29/2016,China G20 West derail agend,business

"SINGAPORE: Oil prices rose in early Asian trade on Thursday, rebounding on a weaker U.S. dollar after falling around 3 percent or more in the previous session following a surprisingly large build in U.S. crude and distillate stocks last week.</strong""The weaker dollar is providing support for oil prices today. The direction of oil prices is governed by supply and the strength of the dollar,"" said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Sydney's Ayers Alliance.The U.S. dollar index slipped against a basket of currencies on Thursday.

That compared with analyst expectations of a 921,000-barrel increase.Distillate stocks, which include diesel and heating oil, unexpectedly rose by 1.5 million barrels, while gasoline inventories fell by 691,000 barrels, about half the forecast drawdown.""In the absence of any price shocks, oil prices remain rangebound - as soon as oil gets down to the lower end of $40 a barrel prices find support. When oil gets down to $40-$42 investors buy, when it gets to $48-$50 they sell again"", Barratt said.Speculation the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers might agree to curb output at talks in Algeria later this month helped fuel an 11-percent rise in crude prices in August, the best monthly return since April.But optimism of an output freeze has since waned.""The market is very complacent on whether OPEC can come up with a supply freeze deal.

"LONDON/JAKARTA: Some of the world's biggest consumer groups are making halal face creams and shampoos for Indonesia ahead of a new labeling law, part of a broader push to cater to growing Muslim populations as sales in many Western markets slow.</strongUnilever, Beiersdorf and L'Oreal are among the multinationals converting their supply chains for the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation.The law, the first of its kind, requires food to be labeled halal or not in 2017, followed by toiletries in 2018 and medicines in 2019.The companies say demand for beauty products that are halal, or target specific issues like veiled hair, will grow as the Muslim middle class grows. They note that Indonesia could influence other countries such as Malaysia where halal products made locally or by small, niche companies are also popular.Halal certification is official recognition that a product was manufactured in keeping with Islamic Sharia law. This means it must not contain traces of pork, alcohol or blood, and must be made on factory lines free of contamination risk, including from cleaning.Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say the burden is more administrative than financial, and therefore see compliance as unlocking new revenue streams.""It's an enabler to do business in certain areas of the world,"" said Dirk Mampe of German chemicals company BASF, which sells ingredients to toiletries manufacturers and now has 145 of them certified halal. The halal ingredients do not carry premium price tags, he said.""There is a trend that these halal products are being requested more and more, and the importance of being able to supply them is increasing.""More than 1.5 billion people around the world are Muslim, accounting for about a quarter of the global population.Halal cosmetics were estimated to make up 11 percent of a global halal market worth more than $1 trillion in 2015, according to Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. Market research firm TechNavio sees halal personal care products' sales growing 14 percent per year until 2019, outpacing the broader market.NOT-SO-SECRET FORMULA</strongFrench cosmetics giant L'Oreal already has a halal-certified factory in Indonesia that supplies the domestic market and its Southeast Asian neighbors. Most products under its Garnier brand, from face washes to skin lightening creams, are halal-certified, a spokeswoman said.The personal care industry already depends largely on plant-derived ingredients, so the rules for halal often affect production more than formulation.But certification can get complicated. For example, the maker of an Indonesian skin cream with a dozen ingredients from around the world would need to give Indonesian authorities proof from other certification bodies that each ingredient was made in a halal way.Malaysia-based DagangHalal has made a business from that complexity by establishing an online database of halal certificates to ease their exchange and expedite the process for applicants. As of February, it said 38 out of over 120 certification bodies worldwide had signed up.The company, which also runs a halal e-commerce site, reported 2015 revenue of 5.6 million Malaysian ringgit ($1.4 million), up 64 percent year-on-year. It raised 3.6 million pounds ($4.7 million) from this year's London stock listing, and is betting that halal cosmetics will gain traction beyond their current strongholds of Indonesia and Malaysia.""Halal certification is a requirement that might be put in place by other countries in the future,"" Joerg Karas, general manager of Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics, said in a statement last month. The German company, which is ready to offer halal-certified products to customers such as L'Oreal and Procter &amp; Gamble, said it is ""well-equipped for this niche market"".Non-halal products will remain available in Indonesia following the labeling law, but may meet a backlash.""The average Muslim consumer in Indonesia is not going to buy something that effectively says prohibited on it,"" said Abdalhamid Evans of halal consultancy firm Imarat Consultants.Unilever, which owns five of Indonesia's top ten beauty and personal care brands, says all nine of its factories there already meet halal standards and that it is currently working with third-party suppliers of imported ingredients.Alan Jope, who runs Unilever's personal care business from Singapore, told Reuters the cost of certification was ""not material"".MUSLIM VALUES</strongCompetition with homegrown rivals steeped in local tradition can be fierce, especially when it comes to regulation. But Jope said the key for multinationals like Unilever -- with global marketing and development teams -- is understanding Muslim values generally and how they influence habits in specific markets with different cultures and ethnicities.""Some (values) are common across Muslim countries,"" he said, noting that about 90 percent of Muslim consumers say faith influences their brand choices.""But there's quite substantial differences between how a Muslim woman in Indonesia and a Muslim woman in Saudi Arabia express their faith and how that impacts their beauty regimes.""He guessed that one third of the top twenty markets for Unilever's 20 billion euros-per-year business were countries with large Muslim populations, from India to Nigeria. He said better meeting their needs was a top strategic priority.To that end, Unilever has introduced products such as a gel body moisturizer that absorbs quickly beneath long undergarments and a long-lasting toothpaste appealing to those fasting for Ramadan.Like rival Henkel, it sells a line of shampoo for veiled hair, but Jope said the industry needs to improve its advertising, such as by featuring more women in hijabs.""We need to be doing a better job reflecting Muslim values in our brand communication,"" he said.($1 = 4.0480 ringgit)($1 = 0.7614 pounds)",9/2/2016,Consumer giants Muslims halal face creams ,business

"KABUL: Tax-exempt military fuel imported into Afghanistan is being sold on the open market, industry officials and a new anti-corruption report reveal, causing the government huge revenue losses as Kabul struggles to wean itself off foreign aid.</strongAn AFP team witnessed first-hand evidence hinting at how duty-free fuel destined for NATO and local forces is being sold commercially when an Afghan energy official swooped unannounced on a Kabul oil depot last week.Flanked by a gaggle of assistants and bodyguards, the official examined a sheaf of customs documents from visibly nervous fuel tanker drivers, scouring the fine print for any trace of the illicit practice that traders have long claimed is crippling the industry.Among the documents from one driver was a ""maafinama"" -- a tax-exemption certificate for military fuel that cuts costs by around $200 a ton -- showing fuel imported from Turkmenistan in the name of the Afghan interior ministry.Only fuel bound for foreign troops as well as the defence and interior ministries -- responsible for Afghan military and police -- is exempted from custom duty, following a security agreement between the government and NATO.""What is this fuel doing in this market?"" asked the official, standing near huge cylindrical reservoirs in the depot that supplies fuel to commercial traders and fuel stations.""That´s the big question,"" he continued as he snapped pictures of the document and truck, pledging a full investigation.He allowed AFP to accompany him during the inspection but requested that his name be withheld for safety reasons- ´Misuse´ -</strongNo commodity is as vital to the reconstruction effort in war-ravaged Afghanistan as fuel -- and none more at risk of being stolen, smuggled or wasted in a country bedevilled by corruption, observers say.Last year, more than one million tons of internationally funded military fuel was imported into Afghanistan, the finance ministry said, with its uncharged customs duty estimated to be around $100 million.""The custom duty exemption mechanism... (for) international forces has led to abuse by fuel traders which allows them to illegally profit,"" said a new report by the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (MEC), which was seen by AFP.The report, due to be released on Tuesday, said 20 commercial companies were issued tax-exemption certificates last year.The process to obtain ""maafinamas"" involves a tightly bureaucratic application system that goes through the US military, NATO and the Afghan finance and foreign ministries -- but the document remains prone to ""misuse"".""Companies that possess legitimate exemption forms have been known to sell the original to other companies,"" the report said, explaining how military fuel was ending up in the commercial market.""(Also) after the customs department process the exemption paperwork, the companies that have been granted exemption forms re-sell the fuel.""NATO said it could not immediately comment, and the interior and defence ministries did not respond to AFP´s queries.Shafiq Qarizada, deputy minister for customs, told AFP he ""cannot confirm nor deny"" whether exempted fuel is washing up in the commercial market.- ´Contaminated´ -</strongThe comments come ahead of a crucial conference in Brussels in October, where donor countries are expected to reaffirm civilian aid funding for Afghanistan over the next four years.Afghanistan is battling what observers label ""donor fatigue"" as efforts to replace its huge foreign aid dependency with self-sufficiency are thwarted by corruption and criminal networks imperilling the already weak economy.Misuse of fuel exemptions is killing local businesses in a country that is heavily dependent upon imports to meet its energy needs, two private traders told AFP.The exemption waves off 12 percent customs duty among other charges, officials say.""Maafinamas have contaminated the commercial market,"" said the official who carried out the inspection.""How can a trader who dutifully pays taxes compete with cheaper maafinama fuel? This is suffocating lawful businesses and encouraging smuggling of fuel... and resulting in custom revenue losses worth millions.""The misuse also has potential military implications.In May last year 17 Afghan policemen were killed when the Taliban stormed their remote base in the mountainous province of Badakhshan.Officials at the time said the policemen were unable to escape because they lacked adequate fuel for their vehicles, raising concern that military fuel was not reaching its intended destination.There are ongoing discussions for a Memorandum of Understanding between NATO and the finance ministry to curb the misuse of maafinamas, multiple sources including Qarizada told AFP.Among various reforms being discussed is a suggestion to levy customs duty on all military fuel and reimburse payments for actual deliveries.""MEC understands from interviews with both (NATO) and (finance ministry) that this reform is strongly supported but it is still not implemented,"" the MEC report said.""Why not?

"HANGZHOU, CHINA: The global economy is being threatened by rising protectionism and risks from highly leveraged financial markets, Chinese President Xi Jinping said at the open of a two-day summit of leaders from G20 nations.</strongHis warning on Sunday followed bilateral talks with Barack Obama that the U.S. president described as ""extremely productive"", but which failed to bring both sides closer on thornier topics such as tensions in the South China Sea.With the summit taking place after Britain's vote in June to exit the European Union and before the U.S. presidential election in November, observers expect G20 leaders to mount a defense of free trade and globalization and warn against isolationism.The global economy has arrived ""at a crucial juncture"", Xi said, in the face of sluggish demand, volatile financial markets and feeble trade and investment.""Growth drivers from the previous round of technological progress are gradually fading, while a new round of technological and industrial revolution has yet to gain momentum,"" he said.G20 countries are set to agree in a communique at the end of the summit that all policy measures - including monetary, fiscal and structural reforms - should be used to achieve solid and sustainable economic growth, Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda said.""Commitment will be made to utilizing all three policy tools of monetary and fiscal policies and structural reforms to achieve solid, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth,"" Hagiuda told reporters on the sidelines of the summit.Xi also called on G20 countries to match their words with actions.""We should turn the G20 group into an action team, instead of a talk shop,"" he said.But some of the G20 leaders have begun drawing battle lines in disputes over issues ranging from trade and investment to tax policy and industrial overcapacity.BATTLE LINESOn Sunday, Xi held talks with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and told him he hoped Australia would continue to provide a fair, transparent and predictable policy environment for foreign investors.China was angered when Australia blocked the A$10 billion ($7.7 billion) sale of the country's biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders last month.China has accused Australia of bowing to protectionist sentiment in blocking the bid for Ausgrid, as well as an earlier one by a China-led consortium to buy cattle company Kidman &amp; Co.Beijing has also criticized Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, for running surveillance flights over disputed islands in the South China Sea.Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said China must set up a mechanism to address its problem of industrial overcapacity, saying it was ""unacceptable"" the European steel industry had lost so many jobs in recent years.""Overcapacity is a global problem but there is a particular Chinese element,"" he told a news conference.Britain's future after its departure from the European Union was also subject to discussion.Obama reassured Prime Minister May that Britain's closest political, commercial and military ally would stand by her.But he did not shrink away from his stance that Brexit was a mistake and that London would not be able to jump the queue to arrange a bilateral trade deal.Juncker said that if Britain wanted access to the European Union's common market, it needed to respect the rules of the common market.Turnbull, meanwhile, said Australia wanted an early free trade agreement with Britain so markets could remain open between them when Britain formally left the European trading bloc.LATE NIGHT TALKSObama held talks with Xi on Saturday that ran late into the night.He urged Beijing to uphold its legal obligations in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, and stressed U.S. commitments to its regional allies.Xi said China would continue to safeguard its sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea.But China is keen to keep the summit focused on economic issues and to prevent other disputes from overshadowing it.According to a ""fact sheet"" on China-U.S. relations issued on Sunday, the two sides agreed on a range of issues, including avoiding competitive currency devaluations and not limiting deal opportunities for foreign information and communication technology providers.Obama, now in the last five months of his presidency, is using the visit to put a final stamp on his signature policy shift toward the Pacific, setting the tone for his White House successor, who will be elected in November and take office on Jan. 20.His visit began chaotically at the Hangzhou airport, where his staff argued with Chinese security over media access. Obama said on Sunday he ""wouldn't over-crank the significance"" of the airport events.""None of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship (with China),"" he told a news conference. ""The bilateral discussions that we had yesterday were extremely productive and continue to point to big areas of cooperation.""Security was extremely tight in Hangzhou, with parts of the city of 9 million people turned into a virtual ghost town as China seeks to ensure that the G20 summit stays incident-free.",9/5/2016,Chinas Xi at G20 says world economy at ri,business

The dollar, which had slumped 1.38 percent on the yen on Tuesday, shed another 0.5 percent to 101.48 yen.The yen gained additional support from a media report that the Bank of Japan's board is struggling to agree on a common front in its planned policy review.The euro maintained Tuesday's 0.96 percent rise against the dollar, the biggest daily gain in three months on Tuesday and last stood at $1.1247.A resurgent British pound rose to near eight-week high of $1.3445 on Tuesday and held firm at $1.3416.Gold rallied to $1,352.4 per ounce to near three-week highs on Tuesday, and last stood at $1,350.0.The Australian dollar took a breather.

Availability of locomotives in freight pool has been improved from 45 to 75 locomotives and all out efforts are being made to increase share of freight earning by giving preference to high rated commodity like POL.The sources said a massive quantity coal consisting of average five trains per day will be transported by Pakistan Railways for Coal Fired Power Plants being established in public sector to overcome the energy crises while terminal facilities are being augmented by introducing latest equipments so as to curtail loading and unloading time.The sources said other steps include High Capacity/High Speed Hopper Trucks are also being introduced for swift movement/unloading of coal, existing track on main corridor (ML-1) will be upgraded under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Freight Transport company has been established to explore new venues for future freight traffic.Similarly, in passengers domain, the sources said under Public Private Partnership (PPP) Pakistan Railways has recently outsourced commercial management of four trains which will generate revenue of Rs. 3.35 billion per annum.Commercial management of Luggage Vans and Brake Vans with different trains has been outsourced under PPP while reduction has been made in fare of different trains.The other measures are introduction of Green line train between Rawalpindi-Karachi via Lahore with extra facilities and amenities for business community, Wifi facility is being introduced in selected trains and at different trains value added services have been introduced to attract passengers.The sources said landmark agreement has been signed between PR and UBL to provide the facility of e-ticketing by the end of October 2016. This will revolutionize the whole concept of reservation and ticketing.A major infrastructure improvement of important Railway stations have been started to give a new concept of state of the art buildings, passenger facilitation and modern business areas within station premises.They said to provide better travelling facilities, economy class coaches are being replaced by Air conditioned standard coaches, extra coaches are also being attached to fetch more revenue and tremendous improvement has been made in service delivery.The sources said to attract more passengers in Holy Month of Ramazan, special package was introduced over the network while Eid Special trains were also introduced.",9/12/2016,PR losses controlled due to passenger friendly polici,business
"SINGAPORE: Crude prices fell over 1.5 percent on Monday after U.S. oil drillers added rigs to look for new production as producers adapt to cheaper crude, with speculators cutting positions betting on further price rises.</strongBrent crude futures were trading at $47.29 per barrel at 0200 GMT, down 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, from their last settlement.U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were down 80 cents, or 1.74 percent, at $45.08 a barrel.Traders said the price falls on Monday and Friday were a result of increasing oil drilling activity in the United States, which indicated that producers can operate profitably around current levels.""Each dollar is being used far more efficiently and, as a result, $50 oil appears much more palatable,"" Barclays bank said in a note to clients.U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a tenth week in the past 11, according to a Baker Hughes rig count report on Friday. It was the longest streak without rig cuts since 2011.Speculative oil traders also became less confident of higher oil prices, cutting their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions for a second consecutive week last week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.Oil's near 5-percent price decline since Sept. 8 partly reverses a 10-percent rally early in the month, which was fuelled by speculation that oil exporters could cap production.Algeria's energy minister said there is a consensus among OPEC and non-OPEC members about the need to stabilise the oil market to support prices, state news agency APS reported on Saturday.OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo told APS that OPEC was not seeking a definite price range for oil but rather ""sustainable stability"" for the market.Moves towards clinching a global deal on stabilising crude output come five months after similar talks for a production freeze failed when Saudi Arabia insisted that Iran join the pact.Tehran says it supports any measures to stabilise the market, but has stopped short of committing to output restraint before its production reaches 4 million barrels per day, the level at which it says it was pumping before the imposition of Western sanctions which were lifted last January.Even if exporters agree on freezing output around current levels, analysts said that would do little to raise prices as most exporters are pumping out oil at or near record levels, and have adapted to do so at lower prices.""Producers and service companies ... are well positioned to return to growth mode at much lower prices,"" Barclays said.",9/12/2016,Oil prices fall US drillers add rigs speculators cut long positi,business
LONDON: Jason Roy fell five runs short of setting a new batting record but his superb 162 still helped England win the fourth ODI against Sri Lanka and take an unassailable 2 0 series lead on Wednesday.</strongSurrey s South African born opener took centre stage on his home county ground and hammered the second highest individual one day score by an England batsman.His fireworks lit up the gloomy rain filled South London skies to ensure England captured the series at The Oval.His second hundred in three ODI games 162 runs off 118 including 13 fours and three sixes helped England clinch a six wicket win with overs to spare as they chased down their revised victory target of 308 with ease.And they clinched the series 2 0 with just one game left in Cardiff on Saturday.It was England s second highest successful one day run chase   and they did it in 42 overs.Sadly for Roy he fell just five runs short of overtaking the highest score by an England batsman with another Robin Smith s 167 not out against Australia at Edgbaston in 1993 still holding firm.He was bowled by Nuwan Pradeep with England in sight of the finishing line.Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler saw them home with 11 balls remaining.At Edgbaston Roy was accompanied by fellow opener Alex Hales who also made an unbeaten ton in that match.But this time he was helped mainly by Joe Root whose 65 showed a return to form for the Yorkshireman who had struggled recently and had gone six games with just one score over 11. But if Root had his mojo back Roy merely continued in the kind of vain which has made him one of the world s most destructive and stylish one day performers.A back injury to Alex Hales during Sri Lanka s innings of 305 5 off a reduced number of overs due to the rain meant Moeen Ali had to open with Roy instead.But Roy shrugged off the early loss of Ali for just two and the batsman cut and carved the Sri Lankan attack apart.England raced out the blocks needing more than seven an over and Roy ensured they were always up with the required rate the skies still dark and threatening to rain once more.Root departed a lazy top edged sweep saw him caught by Nuwan Pradeep off Danushka Gunathilaka and his 149 run second wicket partnership with Roy came to a sad end.Morgan looked well set until he was superbly caught by the diving Gunathilaka for 22 off Suranga Lakmal with England on 221. Roy was joined by Jonny Bairstow and reached 150 but was kicking himself when he was bowled by Pradeep with England so close to the finishing line.Earlier Sri Lanka had produced their best batting display of the series so far with four men hitting half centuries.The tourists recovered from losing opener Kusal Perera in the second over run out by Jonny Bairstow for just a single to give England s attack the run around.Morgan chose to field first and he may have been regretting it for a while as Gunathilake and Kusal Mendis put on 128 for the second wicket off just 111 balls.Mendis was struck 13 boundaries in his 77 while Gunathilaka was also aggressive with seven fours in his 62. The persistent rain finally came down hard enough to force the players from the field for a two and a half hour delay with Sri Lanka on 127 1 from 18.1 overs at the time.England fought back with Adil Rashid claiming the wickets of Mendis (77) and Gunathilaka (62) but England still had to deal with the in form Chandimal (63) and his captain Angelo Matthews (67 not out) who picked up the gauntlet.and helped Sri Lanka amass 305 5 from 42 overs.England s target was revised up by just three runs but with Roy building up a full head of steam they cruised home comfortably.,6/30/2016,Jason Roy stunning knock powers England victory,sports
"LONDON: Few players have reduced the great Roger Federer to a role as secondary attraction on Wimbledon's Centre Court but for one hour and 25 minutes on Wednesday he had just a walk-on part in the Marcus Willis fairytale.</strongThe seven-times champion enjoys too much deep-rooted affection at the All England Club to be cast as a real pantomime villain, but for once the cheers were all behind the 25-year-old local hero on the other side of the net.Federer's 81st Wimbledon match, of course, ended in victory.Even the most over-egged Hollywood script could not have had him losing to world number 772 Willis, whose transformation from a 30 pounds ($40.30) an hour tennis coach to Wimbledon sensation has captured the imagination of the sporting world.But the swaggering Swiss was at least made to break sweat under the closed roof before claiming a 6-0 6-3 6-4 victory.Willis had his photo taken with Federer, 34, before the warm-up and could hardly stop grinning.He even celebrated a practise serve with a raised fist as his friends went through their song-list at court side.But when Willis lost the opening set in 25 minutes without managing a game you feared the worst.DEAFENING ROAR</strongSo when he did finally trouble the scoreboard, holding serve in the eighth game, the deafening roar rivalled the one heard when fellow Briton Andy Murray ended 77 years of pain by beating Novak Djokovic in the 2013 final.From then on the quirky left-hander's unorthodox shots kept 17-times major champion Federer guessing at times, especially his grass-hugging backhand slices and cheeky drop volleys.Federer joined in with some dazzling party pieces of his own but played largely within himself -- smiling occasionally as Willis bathed in an unfamiliar spotlight.Afterwards he paid Willis the ultimate compliment.""I'll remember most of the Centre Court matches here at Wimbledon, but this one will stand out because it's that special and probably not going to happen again for me to play against a guy 770 in the world,"" Federer told reporters.""The support he got, the great points he played. In some ways, I enjoyed it as much as I possibly could, but I also had to put my head down and focus hard to get the lead.""PUSHED HARDER</strongFederer broke for a 5-2 lead in the second and closed it out two games later but was pushed harder in the third as Willis, who survived six qualifying rounds before stunning Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis in round one, kept his nose in front.Federer, moving well after missing the French Open with a back injury, looked a touch relieved when he broke at 4-4 in the third set, though, and claimed victory when Willis sliced a backhand long in the next game.""Today again, after the match, I just said he played great and I wished him the best for the rest of the year,"" Federer said. ""I said a few days ago, this story is gold.""Willis, cheered on by his parents and his girlfriend who persuaded him to continue his professional career rather than coach in the U.S., walked off with his head held high.His mates sang ""Shoes off, if you love Willis! -- a bizarre chant they started when he was beating 54th ranked Berankis.""I have had a fantastic couple of weeks. I will keep going and do what I have been doing,"" said Willis. ""There is life after Wimbledon and I want more experiences like this. I've earned myself a beer now!""",6/30/2016,Federer plays cameo role to end Willis fairy,sports

Boring is not a word which could be used to describe the flamboyant Ibrahimovic, who scored 50 goals in 51 matches for PSG last season.United have not yet confirmed the deal but British media reported that he will undergo a medical at Old Trafford on Friday.Ibrahimovic announced his retirement from international football last week after Sweden's early exit from Euro 2016.He will link up with his new team mates next month and could feature on the club's tour of Asia, for which they are due to depart on July 19.",7/1/2016,Zlatan Ibrahimovic to join Manchester United,sports
"CANBERRA: Australia coach Darren Lehmann has urged cricket's governing body to help reduce the workload on players competing in all three forms of the game as he fears the current packed schedule is unsustainable.</strongAs the Indian Premier League (IPL) appears set to capitalise on recent International Cricket Council (ICC) changes to the schedule through a ""mini IPL"" in September, Lehmann fears such a tournament would further restrict time off for his players.In 2015, Australian cricketers who played all three formats spent on average 280 days overseas. Under Cricket Australia (CA) contracts, players are given a six-week break from commitments, which many use to sign lucrative IPL contracts.Lehmann said that while the financial incentive to play in India was tempting, it often wore players out and the ICC should use a common sense approach to future scheduling so that the toll on bodies was not too high.""If it keeps going like this, with players playing IPL as well, they are inevitably going to break down,"" Lehmann told Australian media on Friday.""Hopefully changes will happen at the ICC and then you will see a refined schedule which will be better.""Lehmann said while players often consider setting themselves up for life by playing in the IPL, it was a ""tough conundrum"" for national selectors, as they are reluctant to advise players not to take on out-of-contract commitments.""If you look across a two-year cycle, all of our players have had to come home at some point,"" he said, while referring to injuries Steve Smith (wrist) and Mitchell Marsh (hamstring) picked up in the most recent IPL season.Lehmann believes that while players may be primed to perform under match day stresses, it was the constant travel, variable conditions and lack of adequate rest which was putting them most at risk.""It's not so much the cricket; it's the travel to these places.

"DHAKA: Test cricket´s newest nations are in despair at plans to split the format into two divisions, fearing it could undo decades of hard-fought progress on the field and kill interest in the game.Cricket´s governing body the International Cricket Council (ICC) is meeting in Edinburgh this week to debate proposals for the seven top-ranked teams to establish a de facto premier league in a bid to boost waning interest in Tests.Under the scheme being considered by the ICC, the other three countries with Test status would join a five-strong second division along with Afghanistan and Ireland.<br/> While the shake-up would guarantee cricket´s leading nations play each other every other year, the other sides would be starved of matches which draw in crowds and lucrative broadcast deals.As things stand, the two latest arrivals at cricket´s top table -- Bangladesh and Zimbabwe -- will be doomed to the second tier and could be joined by another relative newcomer Sri Lanka.""This will spell the death of international cricket as we´ve known it,"" said Ahmed Sazzadul Alam, a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) director.Bangladesh lobbied for years to join cricket´s elite before playing their first Test in 2000. Their record has been poor, winning just seven of their 93 Tests and they are currently ranked ninth, just above Zimbabwe.However, performances have improved significantly of late and Bangladesh have only lost six of their last 18 Tests.BCB vice president Mahbubul Anam warned Bangladesh ""would go backwards"" if they stop playing teams such as England and India, both of whom they are due to play later this year. ""The more we play against competitive sides, the better we´ll get,"" said Anam.Alistair Campbell, a former director of Zimbabwe´s board, appreciated the arguments for a split because of the gulf in class between the top and bottom sides.But Campbell, a former captain who played in Zimbabwe´s inaugural Test against India in 1992, said it would be heartbreaking if current players would never be able to compete against the best.""It´s going to be a tragedy if you are growing up in a country like Zimbabwe or Bangladesh,"" he told AFP.

That might drive players to go and seek greener pastures.""There are similar fears in Sri Lanka which has fallen down the rankings in the last two years after batting greats Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene retired.<br/> Sri Lanka are currently ranked seventh and in danger of being overtaken by an improving West Indies by the time the proposed split comes into force.Sri Lanka also struggled in the first decade after their inaugural Test in 1982 but then found their feet and won the 1996 World Cup.Sidath Wettimuny, who scored Sri Lanka´s first Test century, warned the architects of the split were playing with fire.""It´s okay to make some tweaks but what is proposed is going to be a disaster in every sense of the word,"" he said.Sri Lankan board´s secretary Mohan de Silva was cool on the proposal. ""We are not very much in favour, but we need to discuss with our executive committee after studying it carefully before taking a final decision,"" he wrote in a text from Scotland.But Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera insisted the shake-up should be opposed as it would ""have a negative impact"".Sri Lanka´s cash-strapped board is hugely dependent on TV money and ticket revenue from tours by the likes of India and Australia.

"Spielberg, Austria: Sebastian Vettel topped the times ahead of his Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen after Nico Rosberg crashed heavily in Saturday´s dramatic third and final practice ahead of Sunday´s Austrian Grand Prix.In a clear signal of a return to form in much warmer weather, with track temperatures at the newly asphalted Red Bull Ring circuit rising to 44 degrees Celsius, Ferrari showed superior pace and tyre performance as championship leading rivals Mercedes struggled.Defending three-time world champion Lewis Hamilton managed to wind up third behind the Ferraris ahead of the Red Bulls of Australian Daniel Ricciardo and Dutch teenager Max Verstappen with Finn Valtteri Bottas sixth ahead of Williams team-mate Felipe Massa of Brazil.But the session was overshadowed by championship leader Rosberg´s crash, which saw the session red-flagged to a halt for 10 minutes. It was confirmed by the team that the German suffered a suspension failure.Rosberg appeared to be pushing for a fast lap on a new set of ultra-soft tyres - on which both Mercedes men have struggled for performance - as he came out of Turn Two.Hamilton had followed him out also on ultra-softs as Rosberg´s Mercedes showed heavy left rear wheel vibrations as he ran wide across the kerb.He seemed to be clear of the controversial yellow ´baguette´ kerbs that were criticised so severely on Friday by Verstappen.Rosberg´s car appeared to suffer a suspension failure and he was thrown into a spin that saw him crash off the barriers on the left off the track before coming to a halt.He was unhurt, but the session was red-flagged to a halt for 10 minutes during which the debris was cleared and an angry Rosberg gave vent to his feelings, waving his arms in frustration in the Mercedes garage.His accident demonstrated clearly how difficult Mercedes were finding it to manage the ultra-soft tyres and extract good performance.On re-start, Hamilton went out and clocked a lap in 1:07.7 to jump to fourth on the monitors, some way off the pace set by Vettel who did 1:07.098, another outright lap record at the Red Bull Ring.In a final flurry of action, Hamilton kept off the kerbs and rose to fourth and then third before the chequered flag.Rosberg´s misfortune may have handed Hamilton a chance to cut his team-mate´s 24-point lead in the title race if he can take advantage in qualifying scheduled to take place later Saturday.",7/2/2016,Formula One Vettel fastest after Rosberg cr,sports

"Le Mont-Saint-Michel, France: Reigning champion Chris Froome says this year´s Tour de France is made for the specialist climbers, but it begins on Saturday with a flat stage favouring sprinters.Saturday´s ´Grand Depart´ takes place at the picturesque tourist resort of Mont Saint-Michel, before finishing 188km later at Utah Beach, made famous as one of the main sites of the Normandy Landings during World War II.One of the big favourites for the opening stage is German sprint king Marcel Kittel, back at the Tour after a one-year injury and illness induced hiatus.Having won the opening stage in 2013 and 2014, Kittel is gunning for a hat-trick, but he knows it will be tough.The other main favourite is his countryman Andre Greipel, who won four stages last year in Kittel´s absence.Neither Englishman Mark Cavendish, who is third on the all-time list of Tour stage wins with 26, nor world champion Peter Sagan of Slovakia can be discounted.A breakaway group will likely animate the first stage, but the sprinters´ teams will never let them far off the leash and will take no chances in reeling them before setting up a fast, furious and perhaps manic bunch finish.Two years ago, Cavendish crashed in just such a mass sprint, breaking his collarbone and being forced out of the Tour.It will take a week for the first true test of the overall contenders to arrive on the seventh stage from l´Isle-Jourdain to Lac de Payolle.From there on there will be four summit finishes, seven hors category climbs and 14 first category ones.Many people believe the overall battle will turn out to be a two-way struggle between Froome and Colombian Nairo Quintana, who finished second to the Briton in both 2013 and last year.",7/2/2016,Sprinters to shine at start of climbers Tour,sports

"Stade de Bordeaux, Bordeaux: Germany won an epic shootout featuring 18 penalties by 6-5 to end their jinx against Italy in major tournaments and reach the Euro 2016 semi-finals after the game finished 1-1 following extra time on Saturday.</strongJonas Hector was Germany's hero when he fired home the winning penalty, after Matteo Darmian missed for Italy, and they will now face either hosts France or Iceland in the last four.The shootout featured seven misses with some near-farcical spot kicks and was a complete contrast to the tense, tactical and highly-disciplined 120 minutes of football that preceded it.The usually clinical Germans, who had not missed in a shootout since the 1982 World Cup, failed to convert three times but still progressed thanks to even more wayward shooting by Italy who sent two kicks wide and had two saved by Manuel Neuer.Germany, who in their semi-final on Thursday, have now won their last six shootouts at major tournaments since losing to Czechoslovakia in the 1976 European Championship final.""It's difficult to find the words. I'm overjoyed that the ball went in,"" said Hector. ""I can't describe the feeling. I took my heart in my hands and just wanted to knock it in.""Germany coach Joachim Loew added: ""I congratulated him (Hector). It was a very special situation. I had a good feeling when he was taking his (penalty) shot.""BIZARRE HANDBALL</strongMesut Ozil had given Germany the lead midway through the second half before Leonardo Bonucci replied with a penalty following a bizarre handball by Jerome Boateng.Germany, who reached their sixth successive semi-final in a major tournament, had never previously beaten Italy at a major finals -- a run stretching back to the 1962 World Cup.Italy's four wins included a World Cup final and two semis and the Euro 2012 semi-final. The other four games were drawn.For Italy, the defeat was the end of the road in a campaign which has already taken them further than expected, with impressive wins over dark horses Belgium and holders Spain.Coach Antonio Conte has been credited with overcoming the lack of natural talent in his squad through tactical discipline and hard work but, with key midfielder Daniele De Rossi joining the injured list, Germany proved to be a bridge too far.""The players have left a significant mark on this tournament and shown that with desire and hard work, you can achieve something,"" said Conte.""Football can bring you joy and can leave a bad taste in your mouth. The players will always have a place in my heart.”TENSE START</strongThe first half was as tense, tactical and cagey as expected between teams who had conceded one goal between at these finals.Germany's passing was slicker, though, and they went ahead the 65th minute when Hector's pass into the area was deflected off Bonucci and fell perfectly for Ozil to guide into the net.It seemed that might be enough to win the game but Italy equalised out of the blue 13 minutes later.Alessandro Florenzi curled the ball into the area, Boateng jumped to challenge Giorgio Chiellini with his arms raised like a basketball player and the ball hit the German's arm.Bonucci fired a superb penalty low into the bottom right hand corner, beyond Neuer's reach.Italy suddenly found a new lease of life as striker Graziano Pelle had a shot deflected wide following a quick break and Mattia De Sciglio fired into the side-netting.Little happened in extra time but the shootout was one of the most eventful ever seen at a major tournament.Simone Zaza, who sent his kick high and wide after an unorthodox run-up, Pelle, Bonucci and Darmian missed for Italy, while Thomas Mueller, Ozil and Bastian Schweinsteiger fluffed their lines for Germany before Hector sealed the victory.",7/3/2016,Germany win epic shootout to end Italy jinx,sports

The reality is he´s back in the game and has served his time.""Broad added: ""I have a little bit of sympathy for Amir but once you´ve received money to do something illegal that is always a bad thing.""We are very well-educated by the ICC´s anti-corruption unit, but at 18 years old you are potentially more vulnerable and susceptible to your elders.""Broad, however, agreed with Cook that life bans were the best deterrent to spot and match-fixing.""I am strongly of the view that one of the only ways we will ever expel this awful disease from our game is to hand out lifetime bans for any kind of fixing,"" said Broad.",7/4/2016,England captain expects rough ride Mohammad Amir,sports

He's an example of what the team is,"" he said.Even so, the 31-year-old three-times World Player-of-the-Year has often struggled with an image problem, especially when he said two years ago that Portugal needed ""two or three Cristiano Ronaldos.""He insists on taking every free kick within - and often beyond - shooting distance, prompting suggestions that he is selfish, and is regularly captured on television cameras remonstrating angrily with his team mates.Nani, a veteran of more than 100 caps, is invariably berated if he dares to try a shot rather than feed the ball to the ""senior partner.""Earlier in the tournament Ronaldo threw a reporter's microphone into a lake when he was asked a question during a team walk and was criticised for disparaging remarks he made about Iceland after Portugal drew 1-1 with the rank outsiders in their opening match.He has not even turned up at any of the daily press conferences which Portugal hold at their camp.Bale, in comparison, has taken part in at least four, looks relaxed, and is not afraid to stir up some controversy such as when he said that no England players would get into the Wales side, adding that Wales were more passionate than their larger neighbours.Television images tend to show him encouraging his team mates rather than gesticulating angrily and complaining.“They are obviously different types of people and different characters,” said Wales manager Chris Coleman.“Whatever Bale brings to the table for us, that's him.

Holding midfielder Sami Khedira will also miss the clash because of a groin injury.Central defender Mats Hummels completes the trio of absentees, sitting out the game due to suspension following a second booking in the Germans' quarter-final victory over Italy on penalties.Chasing a fourth European title, Germany could also be without Bastian Schweinsteiger. Loew has ruled out using his captain unless he has recovered fully from a knee ligament injury.The German boss has to decide what to do with his forward line and whether to use Mario Goetze, Lukas Podolski, Thomas Mueller or Leroy Sane. Goetze and Mueller have both been struggling with their form.In defence Loew is unlikely to deploy a three-man central defence as he did against Italy.""Against France I still have to think about it. Italy are a team with automated plays. They are world class in playing them but they are predictable,"" Loew told reporters.""France are different. They constantly change positions, they are much more unexpected and difficult to predict.""Loew is likely to use Emre Can as Khedira's replacement with Benedikt Hoewedes slipping into the central defence for Hummels.The French are feeling confident following their 5-2 demolition of Iceland and the euphoria in the country is growing. But, in order to reach a home final in Paris on July 10, Didier Deschamp's team must plug their porous defence.Leading 4-0 at halftime against Iceland, France dropped their guard, conceding two goals. Centre back Samuel Umtiti, playing his first international, was not totally commanding and Adil Rami, who was suspended, could return for the German game.Rami, however, has shown signs of nerves on several occasions, as has left back Patrice Evra, leaving France's defence looking vulnerable, notably from set pieces.""We're looking better but Germany remains Germany,"" said Deschamps, whose side lost to the eventual winners in the 2014 World Cup quarter-finals as well as suffering painful semi-final defeats to the Germans at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups.""They are the best team in Europe and in the world and the only ones totally controlling the situation, with technical quality everywhere, from the goalkeeper to the forwards,"" said the coach.""We'll fight for our chances, knowing what we are up against.""",7/6/2016,Germany forced to make key changes for semi fi,sports

"MARSEILLE:</ When France meet Portugal in Sunday's Euro 2016 final, the outcome is likely to depend on the performances of Cristiano Ronaldo and Antoine Griezmann -- the second time the two players have clashed with a European trophy at stake in six weeks.Portugal's Ronaldo steered Real Madrid to their Champions League triumph at the end of May after his French rival Griezmann missed a penalty for city rivals Atletico.The France striker has certainly bounced back from that disappointment. He is the competition's top scorer with six goals, having scored both goals in Thursday's defeat of world champions Germany.Portugal's master tactician Fernando Santos needs to cut supply lines to a player whom the French call ""Monsieur Griezmann"" as a sign of respect -- despite his boyish looks.It will be a challenge.While Portugal saw off Wales, the Welsh playmaker Gareth Bale was still given enough space to create chances and were outdone more by the absence of midfield creativity than by Portuguese prowess.That will not be the case for France who have a larger arsenal. Even if Portugal can snuff out Griezmann, Dmitiri Payet, the stand-out performer in the earlier rounds, can change a game in seconds.Front man Olivier Giroud has also proved a handful by weighing on defences and making space for those around him.TEAM SPIRIT</strongWhat has worked for Portugal has been an incredible team spirit with a mantra that they are not playing to look pretty, but to win, irrespective of style.Santos has fashioned a well-drilled 4-4-2 and kept to it throughout despite injuries. The loss of Pepe at the back was hardly noticeable against Wales with Bruno Alves stepping in admirably.From France's match with Germany, Santos will have noted that Didier Deschamps' team has a weakness on its flanks, in particular on the left with Patrice Evra.The Germans pushed the French very deep by using their full backs almost as wingers. For much of the match, France's midfield duo of Paul Pogba and Blaise Matudi chased shadows, leaving Joshua Kimmich and Jonas Hector with acres of space.Portugal's full backs Raphael Guerreiro and Cedric Soares are good enough to replicate that, which could push Deschamps to move away from the more attacking 4-2-3-1 formation to revert to a 4-3-3, restoring defensive midfielder N'Golo Kante.But whether the Portuguese midfield has the capacity of a Bastian Schweinsteiger or Toni Kroos to stifle France is questionable.NO DEPENDENCY ON RONALDO</strongDanilo, who replaced William Carvalho against Wales, was strong and efficient in the holding midfield role, but has limits going forward.Joao Mario and Adrien Silva do not appear to have the killer pass for Ronaldo or strike partner Nani. That may open the door for playmaker Joao Moutinho to return.What has been evident with this Portugal side is that they are no longer a side entirely dependent on Ronaldo. On the contrary, when he goes missing, others shine.In the quarter-final against Poland, 18-year-old Renato Sanches took the plaudits, while Nani has netted three times.Portugal's most high-profile player may have three goals, but his Real Madrid explosiveness has been absent. He has had to fit into Santos' team ethos, playing a less glamorous role. Captain Ronaldo tracks back and encourages his teammates.Arguably by being quiet he may prove more lethal. France's defenders can not fall into the sleepy rhythm Portugal have set during the tournament because Ronaldo has enough to turn the tide as his majestic header against Wales showed.",7/8/2016,Griezmann and Ronaldo clash in final for second time in six ,sports

"SEOUL: South Korean swimming star Park Tae-Hwan, who was barred from the Olympics for doping, will compete for the national team in Rio after the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) ruled in his favour.The multiple Olympic medallist had sought ""an urgent ruling"" from the Lausanne-based body against his doping ban by July 8 -- the deadline for South Korea to select their Rio swimming team.""We will include Park Tae-Hwan in the list of national athletes who will take part in the Rio Olympics"", Korean Olympic Committee (KOC) Secretary General Cho Young-Ho was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency.Park, 26, was slapped with an 18-month suspension after testing positive for an anabolic steroid in out-of-competition controls before the 2014 Asian Games.The ban lapsed in April, but Park remained barred from the 2016 Olympics under a KOC rule which prohibits athletes from representing the country for three years after a doping ban expires.CAS ruled Friday that KOC´s extended ban constituted a double jeopardy for Park and should be nullified, according to KOC.South Korea´s Olympic committee had said earlier Friday it would abide by the CAS ruling.Park -- once the poster boy of South Korean swimming before the doping scandal -- has repeatedly begged for a chance to compete in what would be his third, and probably last, Olympics.He won 400m freestyle gold and 200m freestyle silver at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and two silver medals at the 2012 London Olympics, as well as 400m world titles in 2007 and 2011. ",7/8/2016,Swimming S Korea to include Park for Rio Olympi,sports

"CHELMSFORD: A fifth won toss in six and Heather Knight had no qualms batting first: England had won all 11 previous matches at Chelmsford and, with that in mind, Tammy Beaumont and Lauren Winfield ensured a 12th was sewn up early with an opening stand of 108. Across the six matches, the first England wicket has been worth 801 - more than half of their team's runs. When Pakistan do return to their own beds, a few of their bowlers might want to check under them to ensure Beaumont and Winfield are nowhere to be seen. Both their half-centuries were typical of their play over the last month: Winfield willing and on the front foot, Beaumont wristy and devastating. The familiarity spread right through to the game's conclusion. Pakistan were run ragged in the field and, facing a total they had no intention of chasing - Danni Wyatt pilfered 11 from the first four balls of the final over to help England set 170 - it was just a matter or whether they would be bowled out in the allotted time. In the end, they finished seven wickets down and 57 short.  England rang changes with the ball, the most noticeable being left-armer Tash Farrant coming in for Katherine Brunt. Having made her debut at the age of 17, Farrant spent two years on the sidelines from January 2014 to February 2016, when Mark Robinson gave her a run out in England's final T20I before the World T20. Hers is an example he was keen to address: a player picked young yet too young to cope with being dropped and overlooked for a prolonged period. Now 20, she looked at ease, cycling through her variations and even nabbing the wicket of opener Nahida Khan with a slower ball that was flat-batted back to her. There were first international wickets, too, for Alex Hartley.  Talking about how easy you find things is one of cricket's great taboos, but even Heather Knight, a measured individual who seems to cringe at her own success, might wonder what all the fuss of captaining your country is about.  From the early part of Robinson's tenure as head coach, it was evident that both he and Knight were on the same page. In one of their first coach-player interactions, Knight said she wanted to move away from feeling like the onus is on her to bat for as long as possible. She wanted freedom. As captain, she has been able to afford that to the rest of her team. All this while questions were being asked of whether life after Charlotte Edwards would really be so rosy. Those answers will not be able to be given just yet, but Knight was understandably punchy in the press conference.  ""There was a lot of noise around the squad before the series and the girls have responded. The cricket we have played has been really entertaining to watch. Everyone is feeding off the success of each other and it's been a really nice place to be."" That last point is key. Perhaps one of the most noticeable elements of this England side is how much more open they seem. And while players young and experienced have commented on how Robinson has created a relaxed atmosphere, it has been particularly clear to former players no longer in the system.  Caroline Atkins, who represented England between 2001 and 2011, was taken aback at how at ease the players were when she was around the team at Taunton as they prepared for the third ODI. It was not an atmosphere she was used to. Isa Guha and Ebony-Jewel Rainford-Brent have also presented caps to debutants during this tour, something that has rarely happened in English women's cricket. Rainford-Brent, who  presented Hartley with her T20 cap before this match, was even invited into the team huddle - a ringed haven usually reserved for squad members.   There are of course elements that still need work. On a personnel level, Kate Cross' return to international cricket, after an impressive pre-season tour of Sri Lanka with the England Academy, was disappointing, as she took 1 for 56 from the 11 overs she bowled across the first two ODIs. Cross will spend the next few weeks up to the inaugural Women's Super League fine-tuning some technical aspects of her game, such as her front arm, before leading the Lancashire Tunder in what is hoped to be a testing fortnight of high-level cricket. She will hope her name will be added to the long list of seamers Robinson has healed.  Long term, it will be interesting to see whether the confidence gained from these six matches can carry through into something more sustainable. This is not a team that likes to blow their own trumpet. But after six matches of runs, wickets and outright dominance, and given the manner in which they are looking to play their cricket, they might have to get used to it.",7/8/2016,Beaumont and Winfield secure clean ,sports

"HOVE: Sussex's openers, Luke Wells and Harry Finch, added 212 for the first wicket before they declared 72 runs behind, offering Pakistanis the chance to see how keen they are for a proper game on the final day.The ball did not swing conventionally before lunch and the lines were not consistent which enabled Finch and Wells to make a flyer: the fifty up in the eighth over, 120 in 27 by lunch.In the first session it was a case of who bowled least worse but in the hour before tea Wahab Riaz provided a reminder of the danger that can be posed almost out of nowhere when the older ball starts to move.Wells was the first to fall when Wahab, who overstepped 10 times striving for pace, returned for his second spell of the day, his first from the Cromwell Road End, and started to find reverse swing with impressive pace: he will never be a bowler picked for economy, but he has the ability to rattle the batsmen. Wells drove flat-footed at a full delivery, edging behind seven short of a century, then Matt Machan was almost yorked first ball before being beaten by his second delivery.Finch, opening the batting for the first time in first-class cricket, reached his century in Wahab's next over, when he square-drove his 16th boundary, but two balls later was tempted into driving a full delivery and edged to slip.At the Sea End, Imran Khan picked up a brace himself, although they owed a little more to the batsmen's errors. Machan was lbw after a horrid swipe across the line then Ben Brown drove loosely at his first ball: 212 without loss had become 233 for 4 in the blink of an eye.Wells' innings was a continuation of a strong run of form for the tall left-hander who had made 181 last week against Glamorgan.

"MADRID: A bullfighter and a man participating in a village bull-run were killed in Spain on Saturday, while another two men were gored by the animals at the world-famous festival in the town of Pamplona.Victor Barrio, a 29-year-old professional bullfighter, was killed when a bull´s horn pierced his chest in front of spectators as he competed in a fight in the town of Teruel in the eastern region of Aragon.His death, shown live on television, was confirmed on the website of Madrid´s Las Ventas bullring, where Barrio began as an apprentice bullfighter in 2010. He is the first Spanish bullfighter to die in a ring since the turn of the century.In the southeastern village of Pedreguer near Valencia, a 28-year-old Spaniard was killed during a bull-run, in which people risk life and limb by racing alongside specially-bred fighting bulls through narrow streets.A bull´s horn pierced his lung and heart as he was trying to help another runner during the event, in which a man was killed last year, a spokesman for the regional government said.Many of Spain´s towns hold summer festivals involving bulls, and several people die each year.The San Fermin festival, in which bulls chase red-scarved runners through Pamplona´s cobbled streets during nine days of events, attracts thousands of revellers from Spain and overseas.In Saturday´s run there, a 33-year-old Japanese man was gored in the chest and a 24-year-old Spanish man in the arm, while 12 others suffered minor injuries, the local government said on its website.The Japanese man was in a stable condition in hospital, a spokesman for the festival said.The four-minute run in Pamplona featured six bulls from the Jose Escolar ranch, one of which separated from the rest and caused panic among the runners.The daily bull-run along an 825-metre stretch of narrow streets in Pamplona´s old town starts at 8 a.<br/>m.<br/>(0600 GMT) and usually lasts between three and five minutes.<br/>There are eight runs in total during the festival.<br/>Over the past century 15 people have died in Pamplona´s event, which dates back hundreds of years, according to a count on the unofficial San Fermin website.<br/>The last death was recorded in 2009. ",7/10/2016,Bullfighter and runner die two others gored in Spanish bull festiv,sports
"Barcelona have launched a campaign in support of Lionel Messi and his father Jorge after the Argentine pair were sentenced to prison terms this week over tax fraud.The campaign, under the hashtag #WeAreAllLeoMessi, asks Barcelona fans to ""express their sympathy for the greatest footballer in the world by voicing their unconditional support on social networks.""Messi, 29, has played his entire club career for Barcelona. ""We want Leo to know that he is not alone,"" the club said on their website (www.cfbarcelona.com).""All members, supporters clubs, fans, athletes, media and everyone else are invited to participate.""Club president Josep Maria Bartomeu also tweeted: ""Leo, those who attack you are attacking Barca and its history.

I fully back that fixers should be banned for life.""With Amir´s talent undimmed, Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq was in no doubt of his potential.<br/>""If you look at his bowling speed, swing and control -- it´s there,"" said Misbah ahead of the Somerset match.<br/>""He can still be the best bowler in the world.""England captain Alastair Cook, who played in the 2010 match, suggested Amir might get a rough ride from the Lord´s crowd.But there were no boos at Taunton and he could well get a polite reception at the ""home of cricket"".<br/>""You don´t see many 18-year-old´s bowl like he did, he is an exceptional talent,"" said Cook at Lord´s last week.<br/>""It will be difficult for us.""Meanwhile Amir is well aware of his good fortune.

It's a good sign,"" said Lehmann.""For us it was a pretty good tick-the-box exercise where he got through and we're looking forward to the next phase of test cricket.""Australia play the first test against Sri Lanka at Pallekele from July 26 and Lehmann said he felt Starc's reverse swing would be telling during the series.""He obviously has air speed, which is going to be important when the ball goes reverse. It's important that we keep him fit and playing. We know how good he can be,"" Lehmann said.""It's all up to him. His ability to knock over good batsmen and also knock over the tail quite quickly, for us, that is a really important thing when you are trying to get 20 wickets in a space of time.""",7/12/2016,Starc 300 test wickets if fit L,sports
